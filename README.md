  <b>Running the Program:</b> A zip file is included within this repository, <br/>to run the code and start the webapp simply open the .bat (Windows) or .command (Mac) file enclosed within.<br/>(I promise these are safe files, they are only needed to set the target directory.) <br/>If for some reason this does not work, you can run it through the CLion IDE by just clicking run after opening the files locally.<br/>
  <b>WINDOWS USERS:</b> The backend was made entirely on macOS, due to this there was some oversights with Windows compilation. The biggest of these was the required dlls. To run this on Windows, you must have either the required DLL files in the folder or somewhere already on your system. They are included in the all-in-one .rar file and also packaged in a seperate .zip of their own. Mac users should not have this issue and can simply run the .command to open the webapp.
