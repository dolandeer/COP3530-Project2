This is where the most severe weather, including tornadoes, occurred. Other, generally weaker, thunderstorms developed along a SW to NE line through Dawson County between 5-6PM CDT.

The primary supercells approached far western portions of Furnas County between 7-8PM CDT, but by this time, they had weakened significantly and were no longer producing severe weather. The original Dawson County activity re-strengthened during the late evening hours, and ended up producing a narrow swath of damaging wind gusts from Phelps County eastward into Adams County. Wind gusts of 60-70 MPH were reported along with damage to an irrigation pivot. This activity weakened as it approached Hastings shortly after 9PM CDT. Additional thunderstorms developed between 9-10PM CDT in conjunction with an increasing low level jet. This activity focused across far southern Nebraska, but any severe weather remained further south across north central Kansas.||Overall, this event was less impactful than forecast. Much of south central Nebraska south of Interstate 80 and west of Highway 281 was included in a ���Moderate Risk��� in the SPC Day 1 Convective Outlook.

Radar data indicated rotation associated with a shower that moved over the area to be very similar to what was observed with the Marlborough tornado a short while earlier.","CSV"

Claudette was declared a Tropical Storm and made landfall in southeast Louisiana during the early morning hours of June 19th. Claudette then turned northeast across southeast Mississippi and across south central Alabama during the morning on Saturday June 19th. ||Tropical Storm Claudette produced frequent tropical storm-force wind gusts across coastal Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle. A few areas of the coast, such as Dauphin Island, Fort Morgan, and the Okaloosa Island Fishing Pier recorded a brief period of sustained minimal tropical storm-force winds. ||The highest wind gusts were associated with strong to severe thunderstorms that developed well east of the center of Claudette. These storms most significantly impacted the western Florida Panhandle. The highest wind gust observed was 81 mph at Pensacola International Airport. A Weatherflow site in Santa Rosa Sound recorded a 70 mph wind gust, which was from the same line of storms that resulted in the Pensacola gust. This line of storms produced wind damage in parts of the Pensacola Metro, especially in Ferry Pass. Pace also experienced pockets of wind damage, including one mobile home that lost its roof ||The highest winds recorded were sustained winds of 45 mph with gusts to 70 mph in Santa Rosa Sound, 58 mph with gusts to 81 mph at Pensacola Airport, 42 mph with gusts to 52 mph at Okaloosa Island fishing pier. In Mobile Bay, 40 mph with gusts to 49 mph at Buccaneer Yacht Club. ||Storm surge inundation ranged from 1-3 feet above normally dry ground across southern Mobile County into Mobile Bay. This flooding resulted in the closure of a few roads, such as Shell Belt Rd in the Bayou La Batre and Coden communities and the US Highway 90 Causeway over Mobile Bay. The highest storm tide recorded was 3.67 ft MHHW at the NOS tide gauge on the Bayou La Batre bridge. In addition to the storm surge, surf heights of 6-12 feet battered the Gulf facing beaches. This impacted the west end of Dauphin Island with a portion of Bienville Blvd closed due to flooding and sand over the road. The Florida side of the Gulf Islands National Seashore was closed for several days due to flooding and sand on roads. ||Claudette produced 3 tornadoes in southwest and south central Alabama: A long track EF-2 tornado that impacted Escambia and Conecuh Counties, an EF-0 tornado in rural Covington County, and an EF-0 tornado in far southern Mobile County. ||A widespread 3-6 of rain fell across coastal Alabama into the western Florida Panhandle. 6-9 of rain was recorded over parts of interior southeast MS, with a station in far western Stone County, 11 miles west of Perkinston, recording 9.43. This rainfall resulted in instances of flash flooding and river flooding across the area.","Heavy rain caused water to cover the road in these areas.","CSV"

By the time the rain tapered off by the end of the 17th, 24-hour rainfall amounts of 5-12 inches were reported across portions of the mountains and foothills. This was in addition to a small area of 5-10 inch amounts that fell across portions of the southern North Carolina mountains during the morning of the 16th. The result of this rainfall was significant to catastrophic flash flooding across portions of the French Broad and Pigeon River basins, including some of the worst flooding to impact these areas in almost 20 years. The most severe flooding occurred in portions of southern and central Haywood County, where a number of fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars and damage occurred.

The only ground-truth report of severe weather came from a CoCoRaHS observer, who noted that severe winds (estimated around 65 MPH) destroyed a farm outbuilding and caused crop damage approximately eight miles south-southwest of Beloit.||This storm first developed/intensified slightly south of the local area over the Russell/Lincoln County border area around 4 p.m. CDT, along a well-defined late summer cold front gradually progressing across the region from west-to-east. Only about 90 minutes later, it quickly weakened over east-central Mitchell County, signaling the end of any severe weather threat within the local area for the remainder of the afternoon-evening, as all further severe activity focused off to both the east and south. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was seasonably-decent, with North Central Kansas receiving a glancing blow from a potent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough swinging northeastward across the Dakotas during the afternoon-evening. However, the aforementioned surface cold front was the main synoptic feature in play, trailing southward through eastern portions of North Central Kansas at mid-afternoon from a deepening 1000-millibar low pressure center over eastern ND. Along and just ahead of this front a very unstable airmass awaited, with the surface temperature/dewpoint in the Mitchell County area at 4 p.m. CDT registering around 94/72 (F). Around this same time, mesoscale parameters featured 3000-4000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.","A local CoCoRaHS observer noted that severe winds (estimated around 65 MPH) destroyed a farm outbuilding and caused crop damage.","CSV"

The tornado then moved southeast and may have briefly lifted, before touching back down and leaving a noticeable swirl in a wheat field between St Joe Road and Wabash Road. The tornado intensified as it moved across Wabash Road, impacting the Fort Recovery Lumber Yard. Multiple roofs were completely lifted off several outbuildings. Additionally, a collapsed cinder block wall was observed at the Fort Recovery Lumber Yard. This was consistent with EF1 damage.||The tornado then continued moving southeast through wooded areas between Wabash Road and Fort Recovery-Minster Road. Hardwood tree damage was noted in the wooded areas. After crossing Fort Recovery-Minster Road, partial removal of an outbuilding roof was noted along with tree damage. More significant damage then became apparent as the tornado continued southeast impacting the Burrville Road/Hart Road area. Multiple homes along Burrville Road sustained substantial roof damage, including total removal of over half the roof of a single family home. The survey team also noted completely destroyed outbuildings, the removal of attached garages, substantial tree damage, and projectiles embedded within an exterior wall.||Several wood power poles along Burrville Road were also completely broken. Debris from Burrville Road was thrown approximately a half mile toward Wourms Road. In addition, the tornado produced damage along Wourms Road, which included more broken wood power poles.

The axis of heaviest rainfall occurred at the head of and alongside the Paradise Creek, which ultimately led to serious flash flooding of Natoma, Kansas in extreme SW Osborne County. The mayor stated that approximately 120 homes had moderate to severe damage, with another 15 likely a total loss. Approximately 22 businesses had water damage. Many people were displaced and had to be rescued from their homes. Comparisons were made to the flash flood event in 1993.||The upper level pattern consisted of diffluent and active zonal to southwest flow, with strong divergence noted in the right entrance region of 90kt 300mb jet streak running from the northern Plains into the Ohio River Valley. A strong 35-45kt low level jet developed during the late evening of the 15th and continued into the early morning hours of the 16th, with strong convergence noted on the nose of the low level jet over central and northern Kansas. The strong low level convergence, coupled with the strong upper level divergence promoted deep lift through the atmospheric column, amidst precipitable water values that peaked near 1.5���, which caused heavy rain rates. In addition, thunderstorms trained over the Paradise Creek basin particularly frequently, further promoting heavy rainfall amounts.","","CSV"

On a northwestward track, Ida intensified into a hurricane on August 27, just before moving over western Cuba. A day later, the hurricane underwent rapid intensification over the Gulf of Mexico as it passed over a warm core eddy and reached major hurricane strength. It was just under 72 hours from tropical depression formation to category 4 strength with 150 mph winds. Ida remained at its peak intensity of 150 mph winds and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars as it made landfall near Port Fourchon midday on August 29th. It didn���t weaken to a tropical storm until it reached near the Louisiana/Mississippi border.||Ida produced over a dozen tornadoes and light to moderate wind damage across southwestern and coastal Mississippi. Around 100,000 residents were without power. Around 100 homes were damaged, 6 destroyed. Storm surge inundation ranged from a few feet in Jackson County to 7 feet in Harrison County. Hurricane Ida caused approximately $10 million worth of damage.","A waterspout moved onshore near Railroad St and Henderson Ave where it caused minor roof damage to several houses.

A highly-sheared environment combined with increasing instability produced numerous tornadic thunderstorms. Severe parameters were supportive of significant and long-track supercells, prompting the issuance of a rare High Risk Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Central Alabama.||A total of 10 tornado tracks were surveyed in Central Alabama. This included 4 EF3 tornadoes, 3 EF2 tornadoes, and 3 EF1 tornadoes. Damage was significant along the paths of the most intense tornadoes and, unfortunately, injuries and fatalities occurred. |Some storms were cyclic, meaning multiple tornadoes were produced by the same storm. The most impressive tornado of the event was the long-track tornado that traveled nearly 80 miles from Hale County to Shelby County. This ranked as the seventh longest single tornado track in the state of Alabama.","National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southwest Marengo County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 115 mph.||The tornado crossed the Tombigbee River from Choctaw County just south of Highway 10. It produced significant damage on South Riverview Lane, just south of Alabama Highway 10. In this area, an older single wide mobile home was destroyed with the frame tossed at least 50 yards to the east. In addition, a large storage building was also destroyed. Significant tree damage was noted in the area with several hardwood and softwoods snapped and uprooted. In this area, the tornado is estimated to have been at low end EF2 intensity with winds around 115 mph. The tornado continued northeast and crossed Highway 10, producing substantial tree damage and also heavily damaging one barn and destroying another. The tornado continued to produce substantial tree damage as it crossed Highway 69. As the tornado moved east of Highway 69, the road network did not allow the survey team to assess the damage over a large forested area. However, damage was noted along Highway 17, north of Beaver Creek Road. It is not known how much farther to the northeast the tornado continued due to no road access, but the tornado did not reach Highway 43.","CSV"

These tornadoes injured 8 people across Middle Tennessee and caused millions of dollars in property and tree damage in many counties. These tornadoes, combined with the 5 tornadoes that occurred just a few days earlier across Middle Tennessee on December 6, 2021, set a new record for the number of tornadoes during the month of December. In addition, many counties that had tornadoes in December 2021 had never recorded a tornado in the month of December before, including Stewart, Humphreys, Cheatham, Wilson, Trousdale, Overton, Pickett, Coffee, and Grundy Counties.","This EF-1 tornado touched down on the east side of Percy Priest Lake near Cooks Landing Court and Stewarts Ferry Pike in Davidson County, and moved north-northeast generally along New Hope Road. Many trees were uprooted with EF-0 roof and siding damage to several homes in Davidson County. The tornado strengthened to EF-1 and turned more northeastward as it crossed into Wilson County, causing minor to moderate damage to numerous homes in the Cobblestone Landing and Eagle Trace subdivisions. One home on Partridge Drive suffered severe damage with the garage and east side of the house being blown out. Further to the northeast, dozens of trees were uprooted along Old Lebanon Dirt Road and Division Street, and Mount Juliet Elementary School suffered minor roof damage. The most significant damage occurred in the Willoughby Station subdivision as dozens of homes between Melbourne Terrace and Greenhill Road received minor to moderate roof and exterior damage, and one person was injured by flying glass. The tornado weakened as it continued northeast, but continued to blown down trees and cause EF-0 damage to homes in the Vernon Hills subdivision and along Wilson Drive and Tate Lane. The tornado apparently lifted after crossing Lebanon Road west of Mount Juliet Road. Wilson County Emergency Management reported a total of 163 homes were damaged in Wilson County.

Across Middle Tennessee, a total of 16 tornadoes were determined to have touched down, making this the 5th largest tornado outbreak on record in Middle Tennessee. These tornadoes injured 8 people across Middle Tennessee and caused millions of dollars in property and tree damage in many counties. These tornadoes, combined with the 5 tornadoes that occurred just a few days earlier across Middle Tennessee on December 6, 2021, set a new record for the number of tornadoes during the month of December. In addition, many counties that had tornadoes in December 2021 had never recorded a tornado in the month of December before, including Stewart, Humphreys, Cheatham, Wilson, Trousdale, Overton, Pickett, Coffee, and Grundy Counties.","Damage from this tornado started in northern Perry County with some uprooted trees and damage to an outbuilding noted along Crooked Creek Road. A swath of uprooted trees could also be seen on NASA satellite imagery between Crooked Creek Road and Highway 13 across the Walker Hollow and Lott Hollow areas. Continuing northeast, the tornado blew down more trees and damaged outbuildings along Red Bank Road before moving into Humphreys County, where a RV was overturned and roof torn off a barn along Highway 13. The tornado strengthened as it moved through rural forests towards I-40, with thousands of snapped and uprooted trees noted on high resolution satellite imagery near and south of the interstate. Crossing I-40 near mile marker 146 and Barren Hollow Road, the tornado continued blowing down thousands of trees as it pushed northeast. The tornado crossed into far northwest Hickman County and continued to blow down hundreds of trees along Duck River Road and Epperson Hollow Road before lifting west of Spence Hollow Road. Total path length of this tornado was around 15.16 miles. Based on newly available high resolution satellite imagery in March 2023, this tornado was upgraded to EF-2 due to the extreme tree damage between Highway 13 and I-40, and the path length and width were also increased.","CSV"

It actually didn't attain tropical storm status until after it made landfall in Terrebonne Parish on the early morning of June 19th. The generally weaker nature of the storm meant that wind and surge were the lesser of impacts. However, a band of very heavy rainfall developed on the east side of the storm and brought several inches to upwards of one foot of rain to the Mississippi coastal Counties. Peak wind gusts across the region barely reached tropical storm strength.","The EF0, 70 MPH tornado touched down near Dellwood Drive and Westwood Drive, where a 12 tree top was broken off the main trunk. The tornado moved northeast to Northwood Ave where it knocked an entire section of a wooden privacy fence down and broke a few 8-10 branches and damaged the roof of a detached garage.  Continuing NNEward, there were small branches down along Woodhaven Ave and the final area of damage was a 16-18 tree top broken/twisted in the 1800th block of 22nd St, and a few additional smaller treetops behind these houses.  Lastly, a large tree (base 28 inches x 22 inches) on the corner of 22nd St and Ingalls Ave was partially uprooted and was leaning toward the north at about a 20 degree angle.","CSV"

A potent mid-level trough was also digging southward through southern Ontario and into the Great Lakes region, and a strong upper level jet streak was present downstream the trough axis, over the interior mid-Atlantic and northern New England. This strong upper level forcing combined with the approaching front and a lingering warm, moist air mass ahead of it caused widespread thunderstorm development on July 1.

An associated, strengthening surface low also tracked out of the Great Lakes and into upstate New York. A warm front associated with this low moved through most of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This front, combined with the remains of widespread convection to the west from the previous overnight and morning hours, brought significant cloud cover to the eastern mid-Atlantic for much of the day on the 29th. This was mainly in the form of mid and high level cloud cover, however, and temperatures still warmed to near seasonal levels behind the warm front, allowing moderate to strong instability to build. Meanwhile, the robust surface and upper level disturbances approaching the region brought both strong forcing and unseasonably strong wind shear. By mid-afternoon, an unusually favorable convective environment existed over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.||The result of this environment was a rare tornado outbreak across the area. Initially, during the mid-afternoon hours, mixed convective modes over east-central Pennsylvania produced a couple instances of damaging wind and brief tornadoes as storms attempted to overcome cloud cover and some light stratiform rain in the area. With time, as storms moved into better instability and a less contaminated environment over far eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, they took on more supercellular structures. Multiple cyclic supercells would go on to produce several tornadoes, three of them strong (EF2+) over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Convection persisted past the sunset hour with little to no loss in intensity due to the strong forcing. The only thing that put an end to the outbreak was the coastline, as storms moved offshore towards 9 to 10PM local time. Even offshore, one supercell continued to exhibit strong rotation and likely produced a strong waterspout for tens of miles over the Atlantic.||Fortunately, and miraculously, no serious injuries or loss of life occurred as a result of this outbreak.

An associated, strengthening surface low also tracked out of the Great Lakes and into upstate New York. A warm front associated with this low moved through most of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This front, combined with the remains of widespread convection to the west from the previous overnight and morning hours, brought significant cloud cover to the eastern mid-Atlantic for much of the day on the 29th. This was mainly in the form of mid and high level cloud cover, however, and temperatures still warmed to near seasonal levels behind the warm front, allowing moderate to strong instability to build. Meanwhile, the robust surface and upper level disturbances approaching the region brought both strong forcing and unseasonably strong wind shear. By mid-afternoon, an unusually favorable convective environment existed over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.||The result of this environment was a rare tornado outbreak across the area. Initially, during the mid-afternoon hours, mixed convective modes over east-central Pennsylvania produced a couple instances of damaging wind and brief tornadoes as storms attempted to overcome cloud cover and some light stratiform rain in the area. With time, as storms moved into better instability and a less contaminated environment over far eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, they took on more supercellular structures. Multiple cyclic supercells would go on to produce several tornadoes, three of them strong (EF2+) over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Convection persisted past the sunset hour with little to no loss in intensity due to the strong forcing. The only thing that put an end to the outbreak was the coastline, as storms moved offshore towards 9 to 10PM local time. Even offshore, one supercell continued to exhibit strong rotation and likely produced a strong waterspout for tens of miles over the Atlantic.||Fortunately, and miraculously, no serious injuries or loss of life occurred as a result of this outbreak. With the passage of a cold front late on the evening of the 29th, cooler, drier, and much less active weather would grace the region for several days as clean-up efforts began.","Observed at the NWS office.","CSV"
