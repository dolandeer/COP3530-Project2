Irene moved through the Caribbean and up the east coast of the United States making landfall twice. She first made landfall as a Category 1 Hurricane near Cape Lookout, North Carolina around 7:30am on August 27, then moved offshore again during the evening. She then made a 2nd landfall, again as a Category 1 Hurricane at 540am on August 28 near Little Egg Inlet in New Jersey. She moved over New York City and then into southeastern New York State and Connecticut as a Tropical Storm a few hours later. By the end of the evening of the 28th, Irene was crossing the U.S./Canada border having produced significant amounts of rain, storm surge, inland and coastal flooding, and wind damage across southern New England and much of the east coast of the United States. ||In Southern New England, the minimum surface pressure recorded was 976.9mb taken at Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield, Massachusetts. The storm surge experienced along the coast was generally in the two to four foot range with a high of 4.78 feet at Fox Point in Providence, Rhode Island. The highest sustained windspeed was 54 knots (62 mph) at the Physical Oceanographic Real Time System station at Conimicut Light in Narragansett Bay, RI. The highest sustained wind speed on land was 38 knots (44 mph) recorded on the Automated Surface Observing Systems at both Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis, MA (KHYA) and Logan International Airport in Boston, MA (KBOS). Rainfall amounts ranged from nearly zero (0.03 at Nantucket Memorial Airport - ACK) to nearly 10 inches (9.92 in Conway, MA). ||Despite the relatively low wind speeds, sustained winds over a 6 to 12 hour long duration resulted in widespread tree damage and resulted in power outages to roughly half a million customers throughout the state. Some of these customers did not get their power back until the Friday following the storm (some five days later). Durring the passage of Tropical Storm Irene, the winds resulted in $25,000 in property damages. ||The Connecticut River at Walpole reached its highest level since the 1938 hurricane.||The collective effects of Tropical Storm Irene on August 28, resulted in 1 fatality, 0 injuries, and $127.3M in property damage in the following counties: Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester (all in MA), Hartford, Tolland, and Windham (all in CT), Cheshire and Hillsborough (all in NH), and Bristol, Providence, Kent, Washington, and Newport (all in RI).","Trees and wires were downed in Pelham on Mount Vernon Road.

The development of the low-level jet added to the already sufficient wind shear for supercell thunderstorms, but also aided the low-level rotation in some of the thunderstorms.

A surface low pressure moved from the Texas panhandle into southern Kansas, with a dry line extending to the south. The dry line moved quickly east before slowing to the east of I-35 in Oklahoma. Dew point temperatures reached the middle 60s east of the dry line, with bone-dry conditions advecting in on the back side of the dry line. The cap that was in place was all but erased by mid afternoon, and thunderstorms quickly developed over eastern Oklahoma. The wind shear in place was more than sufficient for rotating thunderstorms, with most storms become supercells. Very large hail and wind damage was common early in the thunderstorm life cycle. A weak tornado developed northwest of Stroud, with other storms showing signs of rotation by late afternoon. Additional tornadoes developed through the early evening, with a couple of them doing damage. The tornadoes were in addition to the hail up to softball size.

Extreme (D3) drought developed across portions of northeast and east central New Mexico early in the month, but rapidly increased to exceptional (D4) drought conditions later in the month in some areas.  Exceptional drought also developed much of central, south central, and southeast areas.   Most of these areas had received less than 20 percent of normal precipitation for the calendar year. The NOAA National Climatic Data Center reported that the first five months of 2011 had been the driest start to any year on record for New Mexico. Statewide precipitation was only 35 percent of normal.  As these drought conditions continued to worsen, human caused wildfires continued to pop up across portions of the state.

The stratus persisted through the 18th before an upper-level trough brought some clearing to the west side of the San Joaquin Valley during the morning of January 19th. An offshore flow developed over California on the 20th, drying the airmass over the San Joaquin Valley and breaking up the stratus.||Although the fog and stratus kept central and southern San Joaquin Valley temperatures near or below normal, mountain and desert locations once again experienced above normal temperatures. Once the stratus broke up, central and south Valley temperatures also warmed to above normal for a few days before sufficient moisture had evaporated and resaturated the lowest levels of the atmosphere. While dense fog had been a nightly occurrence since January 21st, by the 24th, the fog was lingering well into the late morning with only partial afternoon clearing. Locations experienced near zero visibility at times during most of late January.

A couple of short-lived tornadoes were reported over Garvin and McClain counties, with some damage reported. The storms continued to develop through the evening hours, with many of them moving over the same areas. The drought that was in place was helped by the welcome rainfall, although a few areas reported brief flash-flooding.","","CSV"

Normally a wetter month, most of the normal spring thunderstorm activity missed a large portion of Oklahoma. The dry April only compounded the very dry conditions seen over the region since the beginning of October 2010. In fact, this is the 3rd driest period statewide since October 1. Agricultural impacts were severe, as most the winter wheat crop was non-existent, as well as losses to other crops.

Exceptional drought also developed much of central, south central, and southeast areas.   Most of these areas had received less than 20 percent of normal precipitation for the calendar year. The NOAA National Climatic Data Center reported that the first five months of 2011 had been the driest start to any year on record for New Mexico.

Exceptional drought also developed much of central, south central, and southeast areas.   Most of these areas had received less than 20 percent of normal precipitation for the calendar year. The NOAA National Climatic Data Center reported that the first five months of 2011 had been the driest start to any year on record for New Mexico.

A dry line had moved just east of the I-35 corridor of North Central Texas and a strong cold front trailed the dry line. Very strong speed and directional shear was noted in the low and mid levels of the atmosphere such that supercells developed. Many of these produced tornadoes across the region.

The worst of the damage was concentrated along Riverview Drive where moderate roof damage occurred to several homes���including large trees into homes.

Some locations received several inches of snow from the early morning until the following evening. A brief break from the generally warmer and dry conditions above the valley floor and the persistent fog and stratus over the San Joaquin Valley finally commenced. Windy conditions occurred in the desert areas in eastern Kern County, with reports of wind damage to power poles, as a result of this low on the 30th. This low trekked across central California during the afternoon and evening on the 30th, and instability was enough for a few afternoon thunderstorms to develop in areas of the southern San Joaquin Valley that briefly received sufficient solar radiation. As a result of this convection, some areas received over half an inch in a period of around an hour and a half. This low moved out of the area by the evening of the 30th, and a cooler airmass remained over the region into the last day of the month.||Prevailing high pressure during most of this month allowed the region to realize below normal precipitation throughout the central California interior and warmer than average temperatures above the persistent inversion layer, or above the valley floor. Much of the San Joaquin Valley actually remained near normal in temperatures, since there were a sufficient number of cloudy days that kept the high temperatures a little below average, while low temperatures generally remained above average due to this cloud cover.","","CSV"

Exceptional drought also developed much of central, south central, and southeast areas.   Most of these areas had received less than 20 percent of normal precipitation for the calendar year. The NOAA National Climatic Data Center reported that the first five months of 2011 had been the driest start to any year on record for New Mexico.

The California Highway Patrol weigh station at the base of the Grapevine had a high of 78 degrees on the 5th, 6 degrees warmer than the previous day. ||A pronounced dry slot developed behind the warm front, and much of the central and southern San Joaquin Valley saw dry weather for the morning of June 5th. ||An upper-level disturbance rotating around the low moved over the San Joaquin Valley during the afternoon of June 5th. This disturbance triggered showers and thunderstorms that produced heavy rain and lightning, but little hail. Fresno recorded 1.16 inch of rain on the 5th, all but 0.06 inch falling after 5 PM. Rain continued in to the morning hours of June 6th, bringing the 48-hour total to 1.64 inch at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport. This made June 2011 the third wettest June on record, and only 0.02 inch behind the second place amount of 1.66 inch (June 1939). The wettest June on record for Fresno was June 1998, with 1.93 inch. ||There were some reports of road flooding from the heavy rains, as well as a few trees that were toppled as the soil became saturated. In the Southern Sierra Nevada, the snow level began falling as the cold front arrived, with late-season accumulating snow prompting a (rare for June) Winter Storm Warning. Up to 9 inches of new snow fell on the high country of the Southern Sierra Nevada on June 5th-6th. ||As the upper-level low came onshore over southern Monterey/northern San Luis Obispo Counties, a strong vorticity maximum was rotating around the low center. This vorticity dropped south off the coast, then deepened into an upper-level low and swung in land over the San Joaquin Valley, triggering thunderstorms over the Southern Sierra Nevada during the evening of June 7th. As the low moved into southern Nevada, a northeasterly flow developed over the Southern Sierra Nevada. This flow pushed debris clouds from the thunderstorms over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley, resulting in a few sprinkles falling as far west as Dinuba, Fresno and Visalia. This flow also caused clouds to pool over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley during the early morning of June 8th, but these clouds dissipated shortly after sunrise.","California Highway Patrol reported flooding on the Tulare Avenue on ramp at CA Highway 41.","CSV"

Very unstable air and strong wind shear east of the dry line supported supercell thunderstorm structures, which persisted as the storms moved into northwestern Arkansas late in the evening. These severe storms produced tornadoes, large hail, and damaging downburst wind across portions of northwestern Arkansas. One of the tornadoes was especially intense, resulting in considerable damage to several towns as well as three fatalities in Franklin County.","This is the fifth of six segments of this tornado. The tornado crossed the Arkansas River, moving back into Franklin County from Logan County. The tornado crossed Carbon Plant Road and W Creek Road, destroying a mobile home and killing another person. It continued northeast across the town of Denning where it destroyed numerous permanent homes and mobile homes. At least 10 injuries occurred in Denning as the mile-wide tornado moved through the town. Several of these injuries were serious or critical and one of the victims died from her injuries on June 14th. She was in one of the many mobile homes that were destroyed in town. Ten 100-foot metal power poles were bent over at the ground by the tornado and many other power poles were snapped throughout the Denning area. Many large trees were also snapped or uprooted. Maximum estimated wind speed in this segment of the tornado based on this damage was about 145 mph.||The tornado moved northeast from Denning and crossed Highway 64, severely damaging the roof of a permanent home and snapping or uprooting numerous trees. The tornado continued into Johnson County, Arkansas.","CSV"

Gusts to around 50 mph were recorded at the base of the Grapevine during the morning of the 4th, but then subsided as the front arrived before increasing again the next day.

Ahead of the low, the warm front moved into the central California interior, bringing mostly light rain. Because the airmass was warm, snow levels were high, around 9000 feet. Also ahead of the front, downsloping winds developed over the Tehachapi Mountains, as well as in the Kern River Canyon. Gusts to around 50 mph were recorded at the base of the Grapevine during the morning of the 4th, but then subsided as the front arrived before increasing again the next day. The downsloping winds also brought several degrees of warming to the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Bakersfield had a high of 83 degrees on June 5th, with the Porterville Municipal Airport only 2 degrees cooler. The California Highway Patrol weigh station at the base of the Grapevine had a high of 78 degrees on the 5th, 6 degrees warmer than the previous day. ||A pronounced dry slot developed behind the warm front, and much of the central and southern San Joaquin Valley saw dry weather for the morning of June 5th. ||An upper-level disturbance rotating around the low moved over the San Joaquin Valley during the afternoon of June 5th. This disturbance triggered showers and thunderstorms that produced heavy rain and lightning, but little hail. Fresno recorded 1.16 inch of rain on the 5th, all but 0.06 inch falling after 5 PM. Rain continued in to the morning hours of June 6th, bringing the 48-hour total to 1.64 inch at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport.

In the Southern Sierra Nevada, the snow level began falling as the cold front arrived, with late-season accumulating snow prompting a (rare for June) Winter Storm Warning.

A couple of short-lived tornadoes were reported over Garvin and McClain counties, with some damage reported. The storms continued to develop through the evening hours, with many of them moving over the same areas. The drought that was in place was helped by the welcome rainfall, although a few areas reported brief flash-flooding.","","CSV"

A see-saw pattern of temperatures led to a generally slow April snowmelt. At Fargo, the first six days of April averaged near normal for temperatures. The next six days averaged above normal, which led to some snowmelt. From the 13th through the 23rd temperatures swung back below normal along with several days with additional snow. At Grand Forks, the temperatures ranged a bit different than at Fargo. The first 12 days of the month were above normal, then the 13th through the 22nd were below normal.

But probably the most profound aspect of the month was an over abundance of precipitation and late season snow in the southern Sierra. In fact, June ended up being the second wettest on record in Fresno where records date back to the late 1800���s. Also, a very deep snowpack over the southern Sierra Nevada yielded|substantial snowmelt through the end of June and produced high flows along all of the rivers in the HSA.||From about mid June on, the Merced river in Yosemite National Park peaked very close to flood stage, and on a few occasions rose just above flood stage and forced several campgrounds to close because of minor flooding. ||Increased snowmelt, especially from mid to late month, prompted large water releases from most of the major reservoirs which in turn produced higher than normal flows along all rivers downstream of the dams.||At the end of the month, most of the reservoirs were holding about 95 percent of their normal water capacity.","Local TV broadcasters reported a property was flooded near the Kings River  near Reedley.","CSV"

San Joaquin Valley fog was generally limited once the cooler, drier air set up over the central California Interior. The eastern, or cool, side of the upper-level ridge remained anchored over the area for the next several days, allowing cool polar air to move from Canada into the region. Basically, the region was sandwiched between an upper-level trough over the Great Basin and upper-level ridge that was centered off the coast; this is a typical pattern that ushers in cooler, generally dry, polar air from the north. Low temperatures fell as low as the lower 20s in Hanford and Lemoore during the first week of the month, including the 7th and 8th. In addition, the Kern County mountain and desert areas had lows in the teens during this period (i.e., Tehachapi, Glennville, Edwards AFB, and China Lake). The airmass began to gradually moderate on the 9th until the 11th, and valley fog returned to the region.","","CSV"

The storm system strengthened as it moved east of the Rocky mountains, eventually becoming a major storm system, with blizzard conditions on the west and north sides of it, and powerful thunderstorms to the south and east. A surface low pressure moved from the Texas panhandle into southern Kansas, with a dry line extending to the south. The dry line moved quickly east before slowing to the east of I-35 in Oklahoma. Dew point temperatures reached the middle 60s east of the dry line, with bone-dry conditions advecting in on the back side of the dry line. The cap that was in place was all but erased by mid afternoon, and thunderstorms quickly developed over eastern Oklahoma. The wind shear in place was more than sufficient for rotating thunderstorms, with most storms become supercells. Very large hail and wind damage was common early in the thunderstorm life cycle. A weak tornado developed northwest of Stroud, with other storms showing signs of rotation by late afternoon. Additional tornadoes developed through the early evening, with a couple of them doing damage. The tornadoes were in addition to the hail up to softball size.

By April 1st, snow water equivalents were estimated to be about four to six inches in these areas with about two to four inches elsewhere. A see-saw pattern of temperatures led to a generally slow April snowmelt. At Fargo, the first six days of April averaged near normal for temperatures. The next six days averaged above normal, which led to some snowmelt. From the 13th through the 23rd temperatures swung back below normal along with several days with additional snow. At Grand Forks, the temperatures ranged a bit different than at Fargo. The first 12 days of the month were above normal, then the 13th through the 22nd were below normal. The snow disappeared first in the northern Red River Valley, while it took longer to melt in the other areas. Overland flooding was particularly bad over portions of Clay County. Hundreds of roads across the area were closed due to overland flooding.","","CSV"

Exceptional drought also developed much of central, south central, and southeast areas.   Most of these areas had received less than 20 percent of normal precipitation for the calendar year. The NOAA National Climatic Data Center reported that the first five months of 2011 had been the driest start to any year on record for New Mexico.

The wind shear in place was more than sufficient for rotating thunderstorms, with most storms become supercells. Very large hail and wind damage was common early in the thunderstorm life cycle. A weak tornado developed northwest of Stroud, with other storms showing signs of rotation by late afternoon. Additional tornadoes developed through the early evening, with a couple of them doing damage. The tornadoes were in addition to the hail up to softball size. By late evening, at least five tornadoes were reported, with one of them rated and EF-3.","","CSV"

By April 1st, snow water equivalents were estimated to be about four to six inches in these areas with about two to four inches elsewhere. A see-saw pattern of temperatures led to a generally slow April snowmelt. At Fargo, the first six days of April averaged near normal for temperatures. The next six days averaged above normal, which led to some snowmelt. From the 13th through the 23rd temperatures swung back below normal along with several days with additional snow. At Grand Forks, the temperatures ranged a bit different than at Fargo. The first 12 days of the month were above normal, then the 13th through the 22nd were below normal. The snow disappeared first in the northern Red River Valley, while it took longer to melt in the other areas. Overland flooding was particularly bad over portions of Clay County. Hundreds of roads across the area were closed due to overland flooding.","","CSV"
