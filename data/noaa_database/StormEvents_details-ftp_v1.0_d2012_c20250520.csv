Easterly winds gusted to 50 to 60 mph for interior southern New England; 55 to 65 mph along the eastern Massachusetts coast and along the I-95 corridor in southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island; and 70 to 80 mph along the southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts.  A few higher higher gusts occurred along the Rhode Island coast.  A severe thunderstorm embedded in an outer band associated with Sandy produced wind gusts to 90 mph and concentrated damage in Wareham early Tuesday evening, |a day after the center of Sandy had moved into New Jersey.  In general, moderate coastal flooding occurred along the Massachusetts coastline, and major coastal flooding impacted the Rhode Island coastline.  The storm surge was generally 2.5 to 4.5 feet along the east coast of Massachusetts, but peaked late Monday afternoon in between high tide cycles.  Seas built to between 20 and 25 feet Monday afternoon and evening just off the Massachusetts east coast.  Along the south coast, the storm surge was 4 to 6 feet and seas from 30 to a little over 35 feet were observed in the outer coastal waters.  The very large waves on top of the storm surge caused destructive coastal flooding along stretches of the Rhode Island exposed south coast.  ||Sandy grew into a hurricane over the southwest Caribbean and then headed north across Jamaica, Cuba, and the Bahamas.  As Sandy headed north of the Bahamas, the storm interacted with a vigorous weather system moving west to east across the United States and began to take on a hybrid structure.  Strong high pressure over southeast Canada helped with the expansion of the strong winds well north of the center of Sandy.  In essence, Sandy retained the structure of a hurricane near its center (until shortly before landfall) while taking on more of an extra-tropical cyclone configuration well away from the center.  Sandy���s track was unusual.  The storm headed northeast and then north across the western Atlantic and then sharply turned to the west to make landfall near Atlantic City, NJ during Monday evening.  Sandy subsequently weakened and moved west across southern Pennsylvania on Tuesday before turning north and heading across western New York state into Quebec during Tuesday night and Wednesday.","The Automated Surface Observing System at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (KMHT) recorded sustained wind speeds of 38 mph and gusts to 63 mph.  In Manchester, a tree was downed on Harrison Street.  In Hudson, a tree was downed on Lawrence Road, bringing down wires that sparked a fire that damaged a house.  In Merrimack, a tree was downed, taking down wires and closing Amherst Road from Meetinghouse Road to Riverside Drive.  In Nashua, a tree was downed onto a house on Broad Street, near the Hollils line.  No structural damage was found.  Numerous trees were downed, blocking roads.","CSV"

Hunting was also affected according to conservation officers, with low pheasant numbers, and disease in the deer population. There were few remaining water restrictions given the much lower water usage compared with the summer and fall, but the low soil moisture levels presented a bleak outlook for the next spring and summer without a very significant increase in precipitation over the winter.

Although precipitation was generally normal to above normal...the amount of excess over the low winter normals was not enough to relieve the dry conditions. The effects of the drought on farmers and ranchers continued, with the poor condition of winter wheat, and the low stock of winter feed for livestock. Hunting was also affected according to conservation officers, with low pheasant numbers, and disease in the deer population. There were few remaining water restrictions given the much lower water usage compared with the summer and fall, but the low soil moisture levels presented a bleak outlook for the next spring and summer without a very significant increase in precipitation over the winter. Drought was generally listed as continued severe to extreme for the area.","Long term dry soil conditions continued, despite normal to above normal precipitation, as the excess over the low winter normals was not enough to relieve the dry conditions. Aside from the effects on winter wheat and available winter livestock feed, hunting was hampered due to reduced pheasant population and disease in the deer population. The future effect of the lack of soil moisture on next spring and summer's farming was feared if the dryness were to continue. Otherwise, few new effects of the drought were noted during the month due to the seasonally low water usage and need.","CSV"

Hunting was also affected according to conservation officers, with low pheasant numbers, and disease in the deer population.

Hunting was also affected according to conservation officers, with low pheasant numbers, and disease in the deer population. There were few remaining water restrictions given the much lower water usage compared with the summer and fall, but the low soil moisture levels presented a bleak outlook for the next spring and summer without a very significant increase in precipitation over the winter.

The effects of the drought on farmers and ranchers continued, with the poor condition of winter wheat, and the low stock of winter feed for livestock. Hunting was also affected according to conservation officers, with low pheasant numbers, and disease in the deer population. There were few remaining water restrictions given the much lower water usage compared with the summer and fall, but the low soil moisture levels presented a bleak outlook for the next spring and summer without a very significant increase in precipitation over the winter. Drought was generally listed as continued severe to extreme for the area.","Long term dry soil conditions continued, despite normal to above normal precipitation, as the excess over the low winter normals was not enough to relieve the dry conditions.

Otherwise, few new effects of the drought were noted during the month due to the seasonally low water usage and need.","CSV"

South winds that had developed over the southern plains tried to bring moisture northward, but quality moisture was lacking, which kept the severe thunderstorm potential more of a marginal threat. A pacific cold front began advancing east through Oklahoma during the late morning hours, with thunderstorms developing over parts of west-central Oklahoma by early afternoon. The thunderstorms were quick moving, and had moved near the I-35 corridor by 3 to 4 pm. Sporadic marginally severe hail was reported, although most locations received much small hail. The main concern with the thunderstorms was the wind. Winds ahead of the front were already gusting over 30 mph. Just off the surface, much higher wind speeds were present. At times, some of the stronger winds would come down to the surface. Strong winds caused isolated areas of damage, with one area near Edmond, Oklahoma, and the other east of Ada, Oklahoma. The non-tornadic winds east of Ada approached 100 mph, causing substantial damage to a double-wide trailer. The damage was local however, with very little damage in the surrounding areas.

Bastrop, De Witt, Dimmit, Fayette, Frio, Gonzales, Karnes, Kendall, Lavaca, Lee, Medina, Travis, Uvalde, and Zavala Counties improved to severe drought conditions (Stage D2). Atascosa, Bexar, Caldwell, Comal, Guadalupe, Hays, and Wilson Counties improved to moderate drought (Stage D1). Due to recent rain only 11 counties still had burn bans in effect. At the end of the month the seven day stream flow average remained in the normal to much below normal range for basins across South Central Texas and the Rio Grande Plains. Area lakes and reservoirs had some improvement, but remained well below normal pool elevations with Lake Travis around 50 feet below normal and Medina Lake near 53 feet below. The Edwards Aquifer rose with the rains and was 5.5 feet below normal and 0.5 feet above the level from one year previous. The City of Austin remained in Stage 2 water restrictions, the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) remained in Stage 1, and the City of Kerrville remained in Stage 3 restrictions.","CSV"

The thunderstorms were quick moving, and had moved near the I-35 corridor by 3 to 4 pm. Sporadic marginally severe hail was reported, although most locations received much small hail. The main concern with the thunderstorms was the wind. Winds ahead of the front were already gusting over 30 mph. Just off the surface, much higher wind speeds were present. At times, some of the stronger winds would come down to the surface. Strong winds caused isolated areas of damage, with one area near Edmond, Oklahoma, and the other east of Ada, Oklahoma.

A convergence boundary combined with little wind shear aloft, ample moisture in the boundary layer and cold air to provide ideal lake effect conditions. These ingredients combined allowed for a steady band of heavy lake effect snow southeast of Lake Ontario. Prior to sunrise on the 30th several inches of snow had fallen across far northwestern Wayne, northern Cayuga and western Oswego county. As the intensity of the snow band increased through the morning hours, the band of snow remained over western Oswego county with snowfall rates between three and four inches per hour over a several hour period.  The focus point for this lake effect snow was on the city of Fulton and vicinity where nearly three feet of snow fell. Snowplows at one point within the city had to stop plowing as visibilities within the heavy snow became dangerously low for driving snowplows. Winds gradually backed to westerly through the day, and by time the band of snow shifted northward it was rapidly weakening, making this event localized to primarily western Oswego county and vicinity.","","CSV"

There were few remaining water restrictions given the much lower water usage compared with the summer and fall, but the low soil moisture levels presented a bleak outlook for the next spring and summer without a very significant increase in precipitation over the winter. Drought was generally listed as continued severe to extreme for the area.","Long term dry soil conditions continued, despite normal to above normal precipitation, as the excess over the low winter normals was not enough to relieve the dry conditions. Aside from the effects on winter wheat and available winter livestock feed, hunting was hampered due to reduced pheasant population and disease in the deer population. The future effect of the lack of soil moisture on next spring and summer's farming was feared if the dryness were to continue. Otherwise, few new effects of the drought were noted during the month due to the seasonally low water usage and need.","CSV"

The combination of snow and wind reportedly reduced the visibilities to just a few hundred feet at times, and resulted in several road closures.  Across eastern Elbert, Lincoln, Logan, Phillips, Sedgwick and Washington Counties, gusty northerly winds ranged from 35 to 55 mph producing extensive blowing and drifting snow, ranging from 1 to 4 feet in depth.  Storm totals in those areas were difficult to measure but estimated to range from 3 to 5 inches.   ||Road closures included:  Interstate 70, east of Aurora to the Kansas Stateline; U.S. Highway 24, from Limon to Colorado Springs; Colorado Highway 94 between Punkin Center and Enoch; U.S. Highway 40/287 between Limon and Kit Carson; Colorado Highway 71 from east of Fort Morgan to Limon; U.S. Highway 34 from Brush to Yuma.||In the mountain and foothills, the heaviest amounts generally occurred north of Interstate 70.  Storm totals included:  13 inches at Estes Park, 12 inches at Genesee and Red Feather Lakes, 11 inches at Glen Haven; 10.5 inches at Livermore, 9 inches, 4 miles west-southwest of Eldorado Springs; 8.5 inches at Coal Creek Canyon and near Crescent Village; 8 inches near Evergreen, 7 inches at Drake and Bear Lake; with 6 inches at Eldora Ski Area, Idaho Springs, Grandby, Gross Reservoir and Nederland.|Along the Urban Corridor and adjacent plains, lesser storm totals from 1 to 4 inches were observed.","","CSV"

A convergence boundary combined with little wind shear aloft, ample moisture in the boundary layer and cold air to provide ideal lake effect conditions. These ingredients combined allowed for a steady band of heavy lake effect snow southeast of Lake Ontario. Prior to sunrise on the 30th several inches of snow had fallen across far northwestern Wayne, northern Cayuga and western Oswego county. As the intensity of the snow band increased through the morning hours, the band of snow remained over western Oswego county with snowfall rates between three and four inches per hour over a several hour period.  The focus point for this lake effect snow was on the city of Fulton and vicinity where nearly three feet of snow fell. Snowplows at one point within the city had to stop plowing as visibilities within the heavy snow became dangerously low for driving snowplows. Winds gradually backed to westerly through the day, and by time the band of snow shifted northward it was rapidly weakening, making this event localized to primarily western Oswego county and vicinity.","","CSV"

Multiple tornadoes, including a few that were strong, very large hail and damaging winds accompanied the supercells that formed through the afternoon and evening. Over a dozen tornadoes occurred in northwest Oklahoma in addition to the numerous tornadoes in Kansas.||Much of Oklahoma remained under clear skies for the afternoon, which coupled with plentiful moisture allowed very strong instability to develop. A dryline stretched from western Kansas into northwest and western Oklahoma through the afternoon hours. Thunderstorms ignited off the dryline in the early afternoon, with the first severe weather reports around 230pm. The first tornado was not reported until nearly 4pm as low level wind shear increased gradually. The tornado reports continued through nearly 1am with the tornado that impacted Woodward, OK the last tornado of the evening.||With the first supercells firing around 2 PM, many dropped large hail, some as large as 3 inches in diameter. Many brief tornado touchdowns were reported as well, with the initial reports north of Woodward, OK. Additional supercells developed through the afternoon with a prominent tornadic supercell developing near Waynoka, Oklahoma. This supercell produced multiple tornadoes near Cherokee and continued moving to the northeast. One tornado with this supercell produced damage to a cemetery west of Byron. Fortunately, many of the tornadoes from this thunderstorm remained over mainly rural areas in Waynoka, Woods and Alfalfa counties.||Another tornadic supercell developed southwest of Woodward before midnight and tracked toward Woodward. The Woodward tornado began around 1150 PM roughly 3 miles northeast of Arnett and moved northeast into Woodward county. The southwest city limits of Woodward were impacted near 1218 AM on Sunday April 15th, 2012 and the tornado finally exited the north-northwest side of Woodward around 1223 AM. The tornado dissipated shortly afterward, 4 miles north of Woodward. Sadly, 6 fatalities were reported with the tornado that impacted Woodward.","","CSV"
