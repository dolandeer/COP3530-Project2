Winds of 50-75 mph and blowing dust caused a multiple car accident near Paragonah on I-15. Several trucks overturned at Point of the Mountain. I-15 had to be closed near Fillmore due to the low visibilities in blowing dust. A wildfire was whipped up near Parowan by the wind, forcing residents to evacuate. At the Cedar City Airport, wind gusts snapped the lines holding down a plane, causing it to smash into another parked plane. Other damage around the state included broken windows, shingles and siding ripped away from homes and businesses, storage sheds collapsing, billboards and marquees blown down, and large trees uprooted or snapped off.

A 10X12 foot pioneer building was lifted, rotated 90 degrees, and moved 8 feet before being dropped back to the ground. At the south end of Manti, the tornado struck the Anderson Lumber business and did substantial damage. A 40 foot semi-trailer, loaded with insulation, was lifted and thrown onto it's side approximately 35 to 40 feet away. A large amount of debris, along with a 10X10 foot wooden shed, was thrown across Highway 89 and over the hill some 200 to 300 feet away. The wide swath of the tornado did considerable damage as it moved through the residential area in Southeast Manti. As the tornado exited the residential area, where some of the heaviest damage occurred, a 26 foot camp trailer was lifted and thrown to the west-northwest some 150 to 200 feet and disintegrated. The tornado continued across open farmland another half a mile or so before dissipating near the mountains. It has been determined that this was a high-end F2 tornado, with winds as high as 157 mph. The distance traveled was 2.75 miles, and the width was 800 feet. Time on the ground was approximately 15 minutes. Estimated damage is around $2,000,000, but could still go higher. Amazingly, there were no injuries.","PDS"

Winds of 50-75 mph and blowing dust caused a multiple car accident near Paragonah on I-15. Several trucks overturned at Point of the Mountain. I-15 had to be closed near Fillmore due to the low visibilities in blowing dust. A wildfire was whipped up near Parowan by the wind, forcing residents to evacuate. At the Cedar City Airport, wind gusts snapped the lines holding down a plane, causing it to smash into another parked plane.

The precipitation type ranged from mostly freezing rain along the Tennessee border to mostly snow at Henderson and Owensboro. Ice accumulations in some of the Tennessee border counties were between one and two inches, causing widespread power outages and downed tree limbs. Further north, places from Paducah to Madisonville received several inches of snow, topped by around one half inch of ice accumulation. Northernmost counties, including the Owensboro and Henderson areas, received about 4 inches of snow and one quarter inch of ice. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week. Travel was heavily impacted by the winter storm. Hundreds of vehicle accidents occurred, including a couple with fatalities (indirect storm fatalities). One man was killed when his vehicle crossed the median and hit a semi on the Pennyrile Parkway near the Henderson/Webster County line. Two men were killed when their van overturned on Interstate 24 at the U.S. 45 interchange near Paducah. In the Tennessee border area, especially Fulton, Hickman, Carlisle, southern Graves, and southern Marshall Counties, power was not fully restored for four days. Carlisle County officials estimated 80 percent of the county was without power. Several counties established shelters for those without power. A local utility company reported this was the worst ice storm since 1983, with thousands of downed trees and limbs. Many of the tree limbs landed across roadways.  A large tree limb fell through a house in Mayfield, causing damage to a bedroom. The winter storm began during the early morning hours and ended late the following night.",,"PDS"

Ice accumulations in some of the Tennessee border counties were between one and two inches, causing widespread power outages and downed tree limbs. Further north, places from Paducah to Madisonville received several inches of snow, topped by around one half inch of ice accumulation. Northernmost counties, including the Owensboro and Henderson areas, received about 4 inches of snow and one quarter inch of ice. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week. Travel was heavily impacted by the winter storm. Hundreds of vehicle accidents occurred, including a couple with fatalities (indirect storm fatalities). One man was killed when his vehicle crossed the median and hit a semi on the Pennyrile Parkway near the Henderson/Webster County line. Two men were killed when their van overturned on Interstate 24 at the U.S. 45 interchange near Paducah. In the Tennessee border area, especially Fulton, Hickman, Carlisle, southern Graves, and southern Marshall Counties, power was not fully restored for four days. Carlisle County officials estimated 80 percent of the county was without power. Several counties established shelters for those without power. A local utility company reported this was the worst ice storm since 1983, with thousands of downed trees and limbs. Many of the tree limbs landed across roadways.  A large tree limb fell through a house in Mayfield, causing damage to a bedroom. The winter storm began during the early morning hours and ended late the following night.",,"PDS"

The precipitation type ranged from mostly freezing rain along the Tennessee border to mostly snow at Henderson and Owensboro. Ice accumulations in some of the Tennessee border counties were between one and two inches, causing widespread power outages and downed tree limbs. Further north, places from Paducah to Madisonville received several inches of snow, topped by around one half inch of ice accumulation. Northernmost counties, including the Owensboro and Henderson areas, received about 4 inches of snow and one quarter inch of ice. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week. Travel was heavily impacted by the winter storm. Hundreds of vehicle accidents occurred, including a couple with fatalities (indirect storm fatalities). One man was killed when his vehicle crossed the median and hit a semi on the Pennyrile Parkway near the Henderson/Webster County line.

This mix changed back to snow on Christmas Day and dropped up to around one foot of snow across northwest New Jersey. Precipitation began as light snow toward midnight on Christmas Eve. As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and freezing rain.Then as warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of northern New Jersey by 9 a.m. EST on Christmas Day. The only exception was in Sussex County where most temperatures remained below freezing. Around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across the state during the second half of the morning. In fact, a SKYWARN Spotter in Sussex County reported a thundersleet storm from 1040 a.m. through 1055 a.m. EST on Christmas morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in Sussex County between 11 a.m. and Noon EST and moved southeast during the afternoon across the rest of the northern half of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 1 p.m. EST in Somerville (Somerset County) and Trenton (Mercer County) and between 3 and 5 p.m. EST in Monmouth County. The heaviest snow fell during the afternoon and lessened in intensity during the evening. The snow ended around Midnight Christmas night.Most travelers made plans around the storm and while there were accidents, no major congestion was reported. The worst reported traveling problems were along Interstate 78 in Warren County, Interstate 287 in Morris County and eastbound Interstate 280 which was down to one lane along the Morris/Essex county border because the other lanes buckled and collapsed. With respect to the snow, the worst problems were in Sussex County where the combination of ice and then heavy wet snow snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Several vehicles also skidded into utility poles. About 7,000 Jersey Central Power and Light customers lost power in northern New Jersey. The number was down to 650 the morning of the 26th.

This mix changed back to snow on Christmas Day and dropped up to around one foot of snow across northwest New Jersey. Precipitation began as light snow toward midnight on Christmas Eve. As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and freezing rain.Then as warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of northern New Jersey by 9 a.m. EST on Christmas Day. The only exception was in Sussex County where most temperatures remained below freezing. Around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across the state during the second half of the morning. In fact, a SKYWARN Spotter in Sussex County reported a thundersleet storm from 1040 a.m. through 1055 a.m. EST on Christmas morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in Sussex County between 11 a.m. and Noon EST and moved southeast during the afternoon across the rest of the northern half of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 1 p.m. EST in Somerville (Somerset County) and Trenton (Mercer County) and between 3 and 5 p.m. EST in Monmouth County. The heaviest snow fell during the afternoon and lessened in intensity during the evening. The snow ended around Midnight Christmas night.Most travelers made plans around the storm and while there were accidents, no major congestion was reported. The worst reported traveling problems were along Interstate 78 in Warren County, Interstate 287 in Morris County and eastbound Interstate 280 which was down to one lane along the Morris/Essex county border because the other lanes buckled and collapsed. With respect to the snow, the worst problems were in Sussex County where the combination of ice and then heavy wet snow snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Several vehicles also skidded into utility poles. About 7,000 Jersey Central Power and Light customers lost power in northern New Jersey. The number was down to 650 the morning of the 26th.    Specific accumulations included 14 inches in High Point (Sussex County), 12 inches in Wantage (Sussex County), 11.7 inches in Barry Lakes (Sussex County), 11 inches in Vernon (Sussex County) and Washington Township (Morris County), 10 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County), 9.7 inches in Newton (Sussex County), 7.0 inches in Hope (Warren County), 7.0 inches in Jefferson Township (Morris County), 6.6 inches in Chatham (Morris County), 6.0 inches in Lebanon (Hunterdon County), 5.3 inches in Somerville (Somerset County), 4.7 inches in Clinton (Hunterdon County), 4.5 inches in Millstone Township (Monmouth County), 4.0 inches in New Egypt (Ocean County), 3.5 inches in New Brunswick (Middlesex County), 3.2 inches in Belle Mead (Somerset County), 3 inches in Ewing (Mercer County), 2.5 inches in Princeton (Mercer County).The northeaster that produced the tidal flooding moved from Mississippi the morning of the 24th to near Norfolk the morning of the 25th to just west of Atlantic City during the afternoon of the 25th to south of Nova Scotia the morning of the 26th.",,"PDS"

In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   In Carson City, the entire roof of an apartment building was torn off by wind gusts estimated at 90 mph.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  Several tractor-trailer rigs were also blown off highways or blown over by the strong winds.  From these accidents, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.

As the morning progressed, the center of low pressure started to track northeast over the Atlantic along a path that hugged the coast.  As a result, a steady rain developed over New York City and Long Island, while freezing rain began to mix with sleet and snow in the lower Hudson Valley.  As the storm started to move east of the tri-state area, winds shifted from the east and northeast to the north or northwest. This allowed colder air to slowly infiltrate southeastern New York.  The wintry mix changed to snow in the lower Hudson Valley during the early afternoon, and the rain changed to snow during the mid afternoon in New York City and during the late afternoon across all of Long Island except for the twin forks region where the rain did not change to snow until that evening.  During the late afternoon and early evening, narrow bands of heavy snow developed and moved over parts of the region, which resulted in large ranges of snowfall with this storm.  As the center of the storm continued to move northeast away from the area, the snow then tapered off to light snow and flurries overnight, ending shortly after midnight in the lower Hudson Valley and New York City, and from west to east between about 2 am and 4 am across Long Island.  Snowfall amounts in Orange and Putnam counties ranged from 10 to 20 inches, 6 to 12 inches fell in Rockland and Westchester counties, and 3 to 6 inches in New York City, except for an area across the eastern Bronx and northeastern Queens, where 6 to 10 inches fell.  On Long Island, 6 to 12 inches fell in Nassau and Western Suffolk counties, while across eastern Suffolk amounts ranged from less than an inch across the twin forks to 2 to 4 inches just west of Riverhead. The wide ranges of snowfall were generally due to narrow banding of heavy snow, but across Long Island the timing of the change from rain to snow also accounted for the pronounced differential of snow received.",,"PDS"

Across the Potomac Highlands, the Northern and Central Shenandoah Valley, the Central Foothills, and the Northern Virginia D.C. suburbs, ice accumulations ranged from 1/4 to ½ inch.  Roads and sidewalks became treacherous and numerous trees and power lines were downed by the heavy ice accumulations.  Around 149,000 customers across the northern half of Virginia lost power as a direct result of the storm.  In Orange, Spotsylvania, and Stafford counties, ice accumulations of a trace to 1/8 of an inch were reported before temperatures rose above freezing by mid-morning.  Icy spots were reported on roads and sidewalks through noon.",,"PDS"

In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  From these, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.

There were three primary episodes of precipitation in December, the first a two-day storm on the 9th and 10th.  With less than an inch and a half accumulation at any one location over the period, flooding problems were not an issue.  However, the rainfall totals helped to further saturate the soil.  The next and by far most serious storm episode begin on the 13th of the month and lasted on and off through the 21st.  A very strong and moist jet stream developed across the Pacific Ocean and brought a series of storms into California.  Wave after wave of locally heavy rain pounded the north bay counties for days.  Flooding became a serious issue, not just for urban and small stream flooding, but for mainstem flooding as well.  Flood warnings were issued for the Russian and Napa rivers and the forecast points along these rivers reached flood stage on the 16th and 17th of the month.  With a flood stage of 19 feet, the Healdsburg gauge on the Russian River crested at 19.56 feet.  With a flood stage of 32 feet, the Guerneville gauge on the Russian River crested at 33.57 feet.  With a flood stage of 13 feet, the St. Helena gauge on the Napa River crested at 15.47 feet.  With a flood stage of 25 feet, the Napa gauge on the Napa River crested at 26.44 feet.  Most of the mainstem flooding was minor in nature but there were areas of moderate flooding, mostly agricultural land.    The last storm  episode occurred from the 28th to the 31st.  These storms appeared to have the development to create serious flooding problems and because of that flood warnings were issued for the mainstems of the Russian and Napa rivers.  The jet stream that set up actually drove these storms further north than expected and the possible flooding over the north bay counties never materialized as serious as believed.  A good 2 to 4 inches of rain did fall over the area during that time with the most significant amounts over the coastal mountains.  Urban and small stream flooding did occur and there was great concern for possible mudslides due to the saturation of the soil.  Historically, December 2002 became the 6th wettest in downtown San Francisco, our most well known location, since records began in 1849.  The total of 12.03 inches was 378% of normal and accounted for 54% of the total seasonal rainfall for that location.

A warm front moved northward throughout the day and became a focus for the development of showers and thunderstorms. With the strong shear present, a significant number of thunderstorms quickly became severe.

Remote wind sensors along the Sierra Crest measured wind gusts in excess of 130 mph. Strongest winds occurred just before the cold front moved into the area at about 5:30 p.m.  Literally hundreds of trees and thousands of tree limbs were blown down across the region.  In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   In Carson City, the entire roof of an apartment building was torn off by wind gusts estimated at 90 mph.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  Several tractor-trailer rigs were also blown off highways or blown over by the strong winds.  From these accidents, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.  The regional electric utility lost 140 power poles and 18 transmission line due to the strong winds, with damages and repair costs estimated at over $3M.  Total regional wind damage costs were estimated at nearly $10M.",,"PDS"

Abundant low level moisture was already in place across southeast Texas. Very strong shear, or turning and strengthening of the winds with height, was expected to last throughout the day. A warm front moved northward throughout the day and became a focus for the development of showers and thunderstorms. With the strong shear present, a significant number of thunderstorms quickly became severe. During an eighteen hour stretch, ten tornadoes and several large hail events were reported mainly north and west of the Houston area.  Locations from the Houston area to the beaches felt the brunt of this event in the evening when a squall line rapidly moved eastward toward the coast. Three injuries and over $800,000 in damage occurred with this outbreak.","Tornado damaged a boat in Cape Royale.","PDS"

There were three primary episodes of precipitation in December, the first a two-day storm on the 9th and 10th.  With less than an inch and a half accumulation at any one location over the period, flooding problems were not an issue.  However, the rainfall totals helped to further saturate the soil.  The next and by far most serious storm episode begin on the 13th of the month and lasted on and off through the 21st.  A very strong and moist jet stream developed across the Pacific Ocean and brought a series of storms into California.  Wave after wave of locally heavy rain pounded the north bay counties for days.  Flooding became a serious issue, not just for urban and small stream flooding, but for mainstem flooding as well.  Flood warnings were issued for the Russian and Napa rivers and the forecast points along these rivers reached flood stage on the 16th and 17th of the month.  With a flood stage of 19 feet, the Healdsburg gauge on the Russian River crested at 19.56 feet.  With a flood stage of 32 feet, the Guerneville gauge on the Russian River crested at 33.57 feet.  With a flood stage of 13 feet, the St. Helena gauge on the Napa River crested at 15.47 feet.  With a flood stage of 25 feet, the Napa gauge on the Napa River crested at 26.44 feet.  Most of the mainstem flooding was minor in nature but there were areas of moderate flooding, mostly agricultural land.    The last storm  episode occurred from the 28th to the 31st.  These storms appeared to have the development to create serious flooding problems and because of that flood warnings were issued for the mainstems of the Russian and Napa rivers.  The jet stream that set up actually drove these storms further north than expected and the possible flooding over the north bay counties never materialized as serious as believed.  A good 2 to 4 inches of rain did fall over the area during that time with the most significant amounts over the coastal mountains.  Urban and small stream flooding did occur and there was great concern for possible mudslides due to the saturation of the soil.  Historically, December 2002 became the 6th wettest in downtown San Francisco, our most well known location, since records began in 1849.  The total of 12.03 inches was 378% of normal and accounted for 54% of the total seasonal rainfall for that location.

Wind gusts reports in the 60-80 mph range were common throughout the day across the entire region, with a few gusts near 100 mph.  Remote wind sensors along the Sierra Crest measured wind gusts in excess of 130 mph. Strongest winds occurred just before the cold front moved into the area at about 5:30 p.m.  Literally hundreds of trees and thousands of tree limbs were blown down across the region.  In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   In Carson City, the entire roof of an apartment building was torn off by wind gusts estimated at 90 mph.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  Several tractor-trailer rigs were also blown off highways or blown over by the strong winds.  From these accidents, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.  The regional electric utility lost 140 power poles and 18 transmission line due to the strong winds, with damages and repair costs estimated at over $3M.  Total regional wind damage costs were estimated at nearly $10M.",,"PDS"

There were three primary episodes of precipitation in December, the first a two-day storm on the 9th and 10th.  With less than an inch and a half accumulation at any one location over the period, flooding problems were not an issue.  However, the rainfall totals helped to further saturate the soil.  The next and by far most serious storm episode begin on the 13th of the month and lasted on and off through the 21st.  A very strong and moist jet stream developed across the Pacific Ocean and brought a series of storms into California.  Wave after wave of locally heavy rain pounded the north bay counties for days.  Flooding became a serious issue, not just for urban and small stream flooding, but for mainstem flooding as well.  Flood warnings were issued for the Russian and Napa rivers and the forecast points along these rivers reached flood stage on the 16th and 17th of the month.  With a flood stage of 19 feet, the Healdsburg gauge on the Russian River crested at 19.56 feet.  With a flood stage of 32 feet, the Guerneville gauge on the Russian River crested at 33.57 feet.  With a flood stage of 13 feet, the St. Helena gauge on the Napa River crested at 15.47 feet.  With a flood stage of 25 feet, the Napa gauge on the Napa River crested at 26.44 feet.  Most of the mainstem flooding was minor in nature but there were areas of moderate flooding, mostly agricultural land.    The last storm  episode occurred from the 28th to the 31st.  These storms appeared to have the development to create serious flooding problems and because of that flood warnings were issued for the mainstems of the Russian and Napa rivers.  The jet stream that set up actually drove these storms further north than expected and the possible flooding over the north bay counties never materialized as serious as believed.  A good 2 to 4 inches of rain did fall over the area during that time with the most significant amounts over the coastal mountains.  Urban and small stream flooding did occur and there was great concern for possible mudslides due to the saturation of the soil.

Remote wind sensors along the Sierra Crest measured wind gusts in excess of 130 mph. Strongest winds occurred just before the cold front moved into the area at about 5:30 p.m.  Literally hundreds of trees and thousands of tree limbs were blown down across the region.  In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  From these, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.  The regional electric utility lost 140 power poles and 18 transmission line due to the strong winds, with damages and repair costs estimated at over $3M.

That night, the storm intensified as it moved northeast, reaching the Virginia coastline by daybreak on December 25th.  During the morning, as the center of low pressure started to track northeast over the Atlantic along a path that hugged the coast, spotty drizzle and light rain began to overspread southwestern Connecticut along with pockets of freezing light rain and freezing drizzle.  By noon, a steady rain developed along the coast, while freezing rain fell across interior sections.  As the storm started to move east of the tri-state area, winds shifted first from the east to the northeast and then eventually over to the northwest. This allowed colder air to slowly infiltrate southwestern Connecticut.  The rain or freezing rain changed to snow during the mid afternoon and became heavy at times by late afternoon.  As the center of the storm continued to move northeast away from the region, the snow then tapered off to light snow and flurries around midnight and ended between about 3 am and 5 am.  Snowfall amounts ranged from 2 to 4 inches at the immediate coast to 3 to 6 inches just inland to 6 to 12 inches well inland, except for portions of western Fairfield County, where most areas received 6 to 12 inches of snow, including the immediate coastline.  The combination of narrow banding of heavy snow and the timing of the change from rain to snow accounted for the pronounced differential of snow received.",,"PDS"

There were three primary episodes of precipitation in December, the first a two-day storm on the 9th and 10th.  With less than an inch and a half accumulation at any one location over the period, flooding problems were not an issue.  However, the rainfall totals helped to further saturate the soil.  The next and by far most serious storm episode begin on the 13th of the month and lasted on and off through the 21st.  A very strong and moist jet stream developed across the Pacific Ocean and brought a series of storms into California.  Wave after wave of locally heavy rain pounded the north bay counties for days.  Flooding became a serious issue, not just for urban and small stream flooding, but for mainstem flooding as well.  Flood warnings were issued for the Russian and Napa rivers and the forecast points along these rivers reached flood stage on the 16th and 17th of the month.  With a flood stage of 19 feet, the Healdsburg gauge on the Russian River crested at 19.56 feet.  With a flood stage of 32 feet, the Guerneville gauge on the Russian River crested at 33.57 feet.  With a flood stage of 13 feet, the St. Helena gauge on the Napa River crested at 15.47 feet.  With a flood stage of 25 feet, the Napa gauge on the Napa River crested at 26.44 feet.  Most of the mainstem flooding was minor in nature but there were areas of moderate flooding, mostly agricultural land.    The last storm  episode occurred from the 28th to the 31st.  These storms appeared to have the development to create serious flooding problems and because of that flood warnings were issued for the mainstems of the Russian and Napa rivers.  The jet stream that set up actually drove these storms further north than expected and the possible flooding over the north bay counties never materialized as serious as believed.  A good 2 to 4 inches of rain did fall over the area during that time with the most significant amounts over the coastal mountains.  Urban and small stream flooding did occur and there was great concern for possible mudslides due to the saturation of the soil.  Historically, December 2002 became the 6th wettest in downtown San Francisco, our most well known location, since records began in 1849.  The total of 12.03 inches was 378% of normal and accounted for 54% of the total seasonal rainfall for that location.  Across the HSA at the end of December seasonal rainfall totals averaged 150 to 200 percent of normal for San Francisco and the north bay, and 125  to 175 percent of normal for the south bay and Monterey/San Benito counties.Some 24 hour rain falls are as follows:DEC 13-18/2002		Storm Total 4pm to 4pmLocation		12/13  12/14	12/15	 12/16San Francicso Bay AreaRichmond		2	1.9	0.51	1.63Concord		0.9	0.5	0.45	0.85Fremont		0.39	0.97	0.22	1.14Kentfield		5.5	4.17	0.91	2.26Livermore		0.38	0.94	0.56	2.66San Rafael		4.51	2.98	1.16	2.72Moffett Field		0.34	1.01	0.73	1.36Napa		             1.8	2.7	0.55	2.27Oakland Musm		2.69	2.09	0.19	2.04Oakland AP		1.17	1.88	0.2	1.27Pacifica		             2.11	2.55	0.17	2.05Redwood City		1.35	2.58	0.34	1.94San Jose AP		0.15	1.08	0.58	1.08San Jose		0.15	0.72	0.63	1.05SFO		             1.04	1.6	0.22	2.23San Francisco DT	1.14	1.89	0.29	1.88Santa Rosa		2.15	3.12	0.85	1.98Monterey Bay AreaBig Sur Station		0.89	2.06	1.01	2.52Carmel Valley		0.09	0.43	0.81	1.73Gilroy		             0.36	0.31	0.98	1.95Hollister		             0.05	0.38	0.44	1.94King City		0.11	0.09	0.26	1.14Mntry NWSFO		0.15	0.38	0.7	1.14Morgan Hill		T	1.22	0.87	2.75Salinas		              0.24	0.64	0.09	0.68Santa Cruz		2.88	3.59	0.46	1.24Watsonville		1.45	2.35	0.6	1.1",,"PDS"

Remote wind sensors along the Sierra Crest measured wind gusts in excess of 130 mph. Strongest winds occurred just before the cold front moved into the area at about 5:30 p.m.  Literally hundreds of trees and thousands of tree limbs were blown down across the region.  In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   In Carson City, the entire roof of an apartment building was torn off by wind gusts estimated at 90 mph.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  Several tractor-trailer rigs were also blown off highways or blown over by the strong winds.  From these accidents, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.  The regional electric utility lost 140 power poles and 18 transmission line due to the strong winds, with damages and repair costs estimated at over $3M.

This mix changed back to snow on Christmas Day and dropped up to around one foot of snow across northwest New Jersey. Precipitation began as light snow toward midnight on Christmas Eve. As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and freezing rain.Then as warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of northern New Jersey by 9 a.m. EST on Christmas Day. The only exception was in Sussex County where most temperatures remained below freezing. Around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across the state during the second half of the morning. In fact, a SKYWARN Spotter in Sussex County reported a thundersleet storm from 1040 a.m. through 1055 a.m. EST on Christmas morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in Sussex County between 11 a.m. and Noon EST and moved southeast during the afternoon across the rest of the northern half of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 1 p.m. EST in Somerville (Somerset County) and Trenton (Mercer County) and between 3 and 5 p.m. EST in Monmouth County. The heaviest snow fell during the afternoon and lessened in intensity during the evening. The snow ended around Midnight Christmas night.Most travelers made plans around the storm and while there were accidents, no major congestion was reported. The worst reported traveling problems were along Interstate 78 in Warren County, Interstate 287 in Morris County and eastbound Interstate 280 which was down to one lane along the Morris/Essex county border because the other lanes buckled and collapsed. With respect to the snow, the worst problems were in Sussex County where the combination of ice and then heavy wet snow snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Several vehicles also skidded into utility poles. About 7,000 Jersey Central Power and Light customers lost power in northern New Jersey. The number was down to 650 the morning of the 26th.

Remote wind sensors along the Sierra Crest measured wind gusts in excess of 130 mph. Strongest winds occurred just before the cold front moved into the area at about 5:30 p.m.  Literally hundreds of trees and thousands of tree limbs were blown down across the region.  In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   In Carson City, the entire roof of an apartment building was torn off by wind gusts estimated at 90 mph.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  Several tractor-trailer rigs were also blown off highways or blown over by the strong winds.  From these accidents, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.

The heaviest snow fell between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST and snowfall rates in parts of the Poconos averaged two inches per hour. The snow ended during the evening, except overnight in the Poconos. The combination of freezing rain, sleet and heavy wet snow brought down a plethora of trees, tree limbs and power lines from Berks and Schuylkill Counties northeast through the Poconos. About 225,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light (PPL) and Metropolitan Edison customers lost power. The 175,000 outages to PPL customers was the second worst on record only surpassed by Hurricane Floyd. Huge trees snapped like twigs and even utility poles snapped. Thousands of trees were knocked down.  Entire sections of new lines, poles and transformers had to be replaced. The restoration process was hindered because many of the outages were in remote areas and the smaller roads were not plowed. In addition, trees continued to fall through the weekend (28th and 29th) and created new outages. Repair crews from as far away as Maryland, New York and western Pennsylvania helped with the restoration process. Entire sections of Interstates 80, 81, 84 and 380 were closed. Interstate 80 was closed at the New Jersey State border. In Carbon County, a state of emergency was declared on Christmas Day and was not lifted until December 29th. Twice the county had to hand emergency response calls to Monroe County. All fire department and ambulance personnel were placed on stand-by. Power was restored for good at the county emergency services during the evening of the 27th. Shelters were opened in five Carbon County townships. Many people resorted to placing snow in their refrigerators to keep food cold and melting snow on stove tops to flush toilets. U.S. Route 209 was closed between Lansford and Nesquehoning because of downed trees. Businesses in Jim Thorpe were closed through the 28th. About 31,000 Carbon County residents lost power. The number was down to 7,700 the evening of the 27th and 1,400 the evening of the 29th (all in the Panther Valley). Power was completely restored on the 30th. In Monroe County, the southern and western parts of the county were hit the hardest. About 16,000 county residents lost power. All power was restored on the 27th with the last restoration in the Pocono Wild Haven Estate in Wooddale. Many vehicles were abandoned and left on roadways. Many roads were impassable during the height of the storm. All county offices were closed on the 26th. The 21 inches of snow in Tobyhanna was a one day December record.  In Berks County 30,000 homes and businesses lost power, two-thirds of them in Reading. Other hard hit municipalities were Sinking Spring, Cumru, Hamburg, Fleetwood and Oley. Several shelters were opened throughout the county. The Red Cross also sent people without power to hotels. All power was restored by the morning of the 29th. Two men in the county died shoveling snow. One was a 57-year-old in Muhlenberg Township and the other was a 78-year-old in Sinking Spring. In the Lehigh Valley, Interstate 78 was plagued with vehicles stuck in snow. There were multiple minor collisions on U.S. Route 22 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 33 and 248. About 5,600 homes and businesses lost power in the valley mainly in Allentown, Emmaus, Salisbury and South Whitehall Townships. In the Philadelphia suburbs the quick accumulation of snow led to many accidents. Vehicles were unable to ascend hills and many slipped and slid into ditches. By the middle of the afternoon there were over 100 reported accidents in Bucks County. Strong winds and sleet forced the cancellation of the annual re-enactment of Washington crossing the Delaware River.

Huge trees snapped like twigs and even utility poles snapped. Thousands of trees were knocked down.  Entire sections of new lines, poles and transformers had to be replaced. The restoration process was hindered because many of the outages were in remote areas and the smaller roads were not plowed. In addition, trees continued to fall through the weekend (28th and 29th) and created new outages. Repair crews from as far away as Maryland, New York and western Pennsylvania helped with the restoration process. Entire sections of Interstates 80, 81, 84 and 380 were closed. Interstate 80 was closed at the New Jersey State border. In Carbon County, a state of emergency was declared on Christmas Day and was not lifted until December 29th. Twice the county had to hand emergency response calls to Monroe County. All fire department and ambulance personnel were placed on stand-by. Power was restored for good at the county emergency services during the evening of the 27th. Shelters were opened in five Carbon County townships. Many people resorted to placing snow in their refrigerators to keep food cold and melting snow on stove tops to flush toilets. U.S. Route 209 was closed between Lansford and Nesquehoning because of downed trees. Businesses in Jim Thorpe were closed through the 28th. About 31,000 Carbon County residents lost power. The number was down to 7,700 the evening of the 27th and 1,400 the evening of the 29th (all in the Panther Valley). Power was completely restored on the 30th. In Monroe County, the southern and western parts of the county were hit the hardest. About 16,000 county residents lost power. All power was restored on the 27th with the last restoration in the Pocono Wild Haven Estate in Wooddale. Many vehicles were abandoned and left on roadways. Many roads were impassable during the height of the storm. All county offices were closed on the 26th. The 21 inches of snow in Tobyhanna was a one day December record.  In Berks County 30,000 homes and businesses lost power, two-thirds of them in Reading. Other hard hit municipalities were Sinking Spring, Cumru, Hamburg, Fleetwood and Oley. Several shelters were opened throughout the county. The Red Cross also sent people without power to hotels. All power was restored by the morning of the 29th. Two men in the county died shoveling snow. One was a 57-year-old in Muhlenberg Township and the other was a 78-year-old in Sinking Spring. In the Lehigh Valley, Interstate 78 was plagued with vehicles stuck in snow. There were multiple minor collisions on U.S. Route 22 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 33 and 248. About 5,600 homes and businesses lost power in the valley mainly in Allentown, Emmaus, Salisbury and South Whitehall Townships. In the Philadelphia suburbs the quick accumulation of snow led to many accidents. Vehicles were unable to ascend hills and many slipped and slid into ditches. By the middle of the afternoon there were over 100 reported accidents in Bucks County. Strong winds and sleet forced the cancellation of the annual re-enactment of Washington crossing the Delaware River.  Specific accumulations included 21 inches in Tobyhanna (Monroe County), 19 inches in Albrightsville (Carbon County) and Blakeslee (Monroe County), 14.8 inches in Pocono Summit (Monroe County), 14 inches in Beltzville (Carbon County), 13 inches in Jim Thorpe (Carbon County) and Vinemont (Berks County), 12 inches in Mohnton (Berks County), 10.8 inches in East Stroudsburg (Monroe County), 10 inches in Honeybrook (Chester County), 8 inches in Morgantown (Berks County) and Schnecksville (Lehigh County), 7.5 inches in Perkasie (Bucks County), 7.4 inches in Williams Township (Northampton County), 7.2 inches at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 7 inches in Reading (Berks County), 6.6 inches in Bath (Northampton County), 6 inches in Easton (Northampton County), 5.2 inches in Glenmoore (Chester County), 4.9 inches in Palm (Montgomery County), 4.8 inches in Doylestown (Bucks County), 3.0 inches in Southampton (Bucks County), 2.7 inches in Green Lane (Montgomery County) and 1 inch in Valley Forge (Chester County)The northeaster that produced the tidal flooding moved from Mississippi the morning of the 24th to near Norfolk the morning of the 25th to just west of Atlantic City during the afternoon of the 25th to south of Nova Scotia the morning of the 26th.",,"PDS"

Precipitation began as light snow on Christmas Eve. As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and light freezing rain. As warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of the Philadelphia northwest suburbs by daybreak on Christmas Day and by mid-morning in the Lehigh Valley and Berks County. In the Poconos, most temperatures remained below freezing and around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across Eastern Pennsylvania during the second half of the morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in the Poconos by 1030 a.m. EST and moved southeast during the remaining daylight hours across the rest of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 11 am EST in the Lehigh Valley and Berks County and between 11 a.m. and Noon EST in the Philadelphia northwest suburbs.

This mix changed back to snow on Christmas Day and dropped up to around one foot of snow across northwest New Jersey. Precipitation began as light snow toward midnight on Christmas Eve. As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and freezing rain.Then as warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of northern New Jersey by 9 a.m. EST on Christmas Day. The only exception was in Sussex County where most temperatures remained below freezing. Around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across the state during the second half of the morning. In fact, a SKYWARN Spotter in Sussex County reported a thundersleet storm from 1040 a.m. through 1055 a.m. EST on Christmas morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in Sussex County between 11 a.m. and Noon EST and moved southeast during the afternoon across the rest of the northern half of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 1 p.m. EST in Somerville (Somerset County) and Trenton (Mercer County) and between 3 and 5 p.m. EST in Monmouth County. The heaviest snow fell during the afternoon and lessened in intensity during the evening. The snow ended around Midnight Christmas night.Most travelers made plans around the storm and while there were accidents, no major congestion was reported. The worst reported traveling problems were along Interstate 78 in Warren County, Interstate 287 in Morris County and eastbound Interstate 280 which was down to one lane along the Morris/Essex county border because the other lanes buckled and collapsed. With respect to the snow, the worst problems were in Sussex County where the combination of ice and then heavy wet snow snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Several vehicles also skidded into utility poles. About 7,000 Jersey Central Power and Light customers lost power in northern New Jersey. The number was down to 650 the morning of the 26th.    Specific accumulations included 14 inches in High Point (Sussex County), 12 inches in Wantage (Sussex County), 11.7 inches in Barry Lakes (Sussex County), 11 inches in Vernon (Sussex County) and Washington Township (Morris County), 10 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County), 9.7 inches in Newton (Sussex County), 7.0 inches in Hope (Warren County), 7.0 inches in Jefferson Township (Morris County), 6.6 inches in Chatham (Morris County), 6.0 inches in Lebanon (Hunterdon County), 5.3 inches in Somerville (Somerset County), 4.7 inches in Clinton (Hunterdon County), 4.5 inches in Millstone Township (Monmouth County), 4.0 inches in New Egypt (Ocean County), 3.5 inches in New Brunswick (Middlesex County), 3.2 inches in Belle Mead (Somerset County), 3 inches in Ewing (Mercer County), 2.5 inches in Princeton (Mercer County).The northeaster that produced the tidal flooding moved from Mississippi the morning of the 24th to near Norfolk the morning of the 25th to just west of Atlantic City during the afternoon of the 25th to south of Nova Scotia the morning of the 26th.",,"PDS"

The storm dramatically deepened as it tracked northeast along the atlantic coast and reached just south of eastern Long Island by late Christmas night. With plenty of cold polar air in place, the stage was set for a record breaking snowstorm across eastern New York, the biggest snowstorm since the Superstorm of 93. The snow began in earnest before midday across the Catskills and Mohawk Valley, and overspread the remainder of eastern New York by the afternoon. During the late day and evening hours, snowfall rates averaged 1 to 3 inches per hour while an intense narrow band, with rates up to 5 inches per hour, set up across Southern Herkimer and Montgomery counties. The bulk of the crippling snowstorm fell in about a 15 hour period, winding down a little after midnight on December 26. A little sleet mixed in across the Hudson Valley during the early portions of the storm, but snow was the primary precipitation type. Snowfall amounts ranged from nearly 3 feet across portions of the Mohawk Valley and extreme southern Herkimer County, to about 2 feet in the Capital District and around a foot or less well south from Poughkeepsie south, and from Glens Falls north. There was a sharp cutoff where the accumulating snow fell across northern Herkimer and northern Hamilton counties, but the majority of population in both these counties were still impacted by 7 or more inches of snow.  A few specific snowfall amounts included 21.0 inches at Albany in Albany County, 8.8 inches at Beacon, Dutchess County, 25.0 inches at Niskayuna, Schenectady County and 23 inches at Cobleskill, in Schoharie County. The maximum amount reported from this storm was 34.0 inches in Cedarville, in southern Herkimer County. The 19.2 inches of snow that fell on Christmas Day easily smashed the 13.8 inch Christmas day record previously set in 1978. It was the ninth greatest snowstorm in Albany's history. Not only did the snow come down at a furious clip, but 15 to 30 mph wind gusts produced some blowing and drifting of the snow and travel was next to impossible during the height of the storm. Near blizzard conditions were noted across the higher terrain, where winds briefly gusted to 50 mph.  Many vehicular accidents were reported and many vehicles became stuck or went off roadways. At one point, the New York State Thruway was closed between the cities of Catskill and Syracuse. Many other roads like Highway 5S were closed as well as all county roads in Schenectady County. A general state of emergency was declared in portions of Herkimer, Montgomery and Schenectady counties. Ninety five percent of the flights were cancelled out of Albany International Airport, stranding many at the airport through Christmas night. A transformer malfunction left 2,600 customers in the dark in the Ballston Spa area with spotty power outages noted elsewhere. The snow removal cost was estimated at 310,00 dollars in the city of Schenectady, and it took days for many side roads to be plowed.

With plenty of cold polar air in place, the stage was set for a record breaking snowstorm across eastern New York, the biggest snowstorm since the Superstorm of 93. The snow began in earnest before midday across the Catskills and Mohawk Valley, and overspread the remainder of eastern New York by the afternoon. During the late day and evening hours, snowfall rates averaged 1 to 3 inches per hour while an intense narrow band, with rates up to 5 inches per hour, set up across Southern Herkimer and Montgomery counties. The bulk of the crippling snowstorm fell in about a 15 hour period, winding down a little after midnight on December 26. A little sleet mixed in across the Hudson Valley during the early portions of the storm, but snow was the primary precipitation type. Snowfall amounts ranged from nearly 3 feet across portions of the Mohawk Valley and extreme southern Herkimer County, to about 2 feet in the Capital District and around a foot or less well south from Poughkeepsie south, and from Glens Falls north. There was a sharp cutoff where the accumulating snow fell across northern Herkimer and northern Hamilton counties, but the majority of population in both these counties were still impacted by 7 or more inches of snow.  A few specific snowfall amounts included 21.0 inches at Albany in Albany County, 8.8 inches at Beacon, Dutchess County, 25.0 inches at Niskayuna, Schenectady County and 23 inches at Cobleskill, in Schoharie County. The maximum amount reported from this storm was 34.0 inches in Cedarville, in southern Herkimer County. The 19.2 inches of snow that fell on Christmas Day easily smashed the 13.8 inch Christmas day record previously set in 1978. It was the ninth greatest snowstorm in Albany's history. Not only did the snow come down at a furious clip, but 15 to 30 mph wind gusts produced some blowing and drifting of the snow and travel was next to impossible during the height of the storm. Near blizzard conditions were noted across the higher terrain, where winds briefly gusted to 50 mph.  Many vehicular accidents were reported and many vehicles became stuck or went off roadways. At one point, the New York State Thruway was closed between the cities of Catskill and Syracuse. Many other roads like Highway 5S were closed as well as all county roads in Schenectady County. A general state of emergency was declared in portions of Herkimer, Montgomery and Schenectady counties. Ninety five percent of the flights were cancelled out of Albany International Airport, stranding many at the airport through Christmas night. A transformer malfunction left 2,600 customers in the dark in the Ballston Spa area with spotty power outages noted elsewhere. The snow removal cost was estimated at 310,00 dollars in the city of Schenectady, and it took days for many side roads to be plowed. In the city of Albany the estimated cost of the snow removal was 250,000 dollars.",,"PDS"

This mix changed back to snow on Christmas Day and dropped up to around one foot of snow across northwest New Jersey. Precipitation began as light snow toward midnight on Christmas Eve. As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and freezing rain.Then as warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of northern New Jersey by 9 a.m. EST on Christmas Day. The only exception was in Sussex County where most temperatures remained below freezing. Around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across the state during the second half of the morning. In fact, a SKYWARN Spotter in Sussex County reported a thundersleet storm from 1040 a.m. through 1055 a.m. EST on Christmas morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in Sussex County between 11 a.m. and Noon EST and moved southeast during the afternoon across the rest of the northern half of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 1 p.m. EST in Somerville (Somerset County) and Trenton (Mercer County) and between 3 and 5 p.m. EST in Monmouth County. The heaviest snow fell during the afternoon and lessened in intensity during the evening. The snow ended around Midnight Christmas night.Most travelers made plans around the storm and while there were accidents, no major congestion was reported. The worst reported traveling problems were along Interstate 78 in Warren County, Interstate 287 in Morris County and eastbound Interstate 280 which was down to one lane along the Morris/Essex county border because the other lanes buckled and collapsed. With respect to the snow, the worst problems were in Sussex County where the combination of ice and then heavy wet snow snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Several vehicles also skidded into utility poles. About 7,000 Jersey Central Power and Light customers lost power in northern New Jersey. The number was down to 650 the morning of the 26th.

This changed precipitation over to sleet and light freezing rain. As warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of the Philadelphia northwest suburbs by daybreak on Christmas Day and by mid-morning in the Lehigh Valley and Berks County. In the Poconos, most temperatures remained below freezing and around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across Eastern Pennsylvania during the second half of the morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in the Poconos by 1030 a.m. EST and moved southeast during the remaining daylight hours across the rest of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 11 am EST in the Lehigh Valley and Berks County and between 11 a.m. and Noon EST in the Philadelphia northwest suburbs. The heaviest snow fell between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST and snowfall rates in parts of the Poconos averaged two inches per hour. The snow ended during the evening, except overnight in the Poconos. The combination of freezing rain, sleet and heavy wet snow brought down a plethora of trees, tree limbs and power lines from Berks and Schuylkill Counties northeast through the Poconos. About 225,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light (PPL) and Metropolitan Edison customers lost power. The 175,000 outages to PPL customers was the second worst on record only surpassed by Hurricane Floyd. Huge trees snapped like twigs and even utility poles snapped. Thousands of trees were knocked down.  Entire sections of new lines, poles and transformers had to be replaced. The restoration process was hindered because many of the outages were in remote areas and the smaller roads were not plowed. In addition, trees continued to fall through the weekend (28th and 29th) and created new outages. Repair crews from as far away as Maryland, New York and western Pennsylvania helped with the restoration process. Entire sections of Interstates 80, 81, 84 and 380 were closed. Interstate 80 was closed at the New Jersey State border. In Carbon County, a state of emergency was declared on Christmas Day and was not lifted until December 29th. Twice the county had to hand emergency response calls to Monroe County. All fire department and ambulance personnel were placed on stand-by. Power was restored for good at the county emergency services during the evening of the 27th. Shelters were opened in five Carbon County townships. Many people resorted to placing snow in their refrigerators to keep food cold and melting snow on stove tops to flush toilets. U.S. Route 209 was closed between Lansford and Nesquehoning because of downed trees. Businesses in Jim Thorpe were closed through the 28th. About 31,000 Carbon County residents lost power. The number was down to 7,700 the evening of the 27th and 1,400 the evening of the 29th (all in the Panther Valley). Power was completely restored on the 30th. In Monroe County, the southern and western parts of the county were hit the hardest. About 16,000 county residents lost power. All power was restored on the 27th with the last restoration in the Pocono Wild Haven Estate in Wooddale. Many vehicles were abandoned and left on roadways. Many roads were impassable during the height of the storm. All county offices were closed on the 26th. The 21 inches of snow in Tobyhanna was a one day December record.  In Berks County 30,000 homes and businesses lost power, two-thirds of them in Reading. Other hard hit municipalities were Sinking Spring, Cumru, Hamburg, Fleetwood and Oley. Several shelters were opened throughout the county. The Red Cross also sent people without power to hotels. All power was restored by the morning of the 29th. Two men in the county died shoveling snow. One was a 57-year-old in Muhlenberg Township and the other was a 78-year-old in Sinking Spring. In the Lehigh Valley, Interstate 78 was plagued with vehicles stuck in snow. There were multiple minor collisions on U.S. Route 22 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 33 and 248. About 5,600 homes and businesses lost power in the valley mainly in Allentown, Emmaus, Salisbury and South Whitehall Townships. In the Philadelphia suburbs the quick accumulation of snow led to many accidents. Vehicles were unable to ascend hills and many slipped and slid into ditches. By the middle of the afternoon there were over 100 reported accidents in Bucks County. Strong winds and sleet forced the cancellation of the annual re-enactment of Washington crossing the Delaware River.

As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and light freezing rain. As warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of the Philadelphia northwest suburbs by daybreak on Christmas Day and by mid-morning in the Lehigh Valley and Berks County. In the Poconos, most temperatures remained below freezing and around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across Eastern Pennsylvania during the second half of the morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in the Poconos by 1030 a.m. EST and moved southeast during the remaining daylight hours across the rest of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 11 am EST in the Lehigh Valley and Berks County and between 11 a.m. and Noon EST in the Philadelphia northwest suburbs. The heaviest snow fell between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST and snowfall rates in parts of the Poconos averaged two inches per hour. The snow ended during the evening, except overnight in the Poconos. The combination of freezing rain, sleet and heavy wet snow brought down a plethora of trees, tree limbs and power lines from Berks and Schuylkill Counties northeast through the Poconos. About 225,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light (PPL) and Metropolitan Edison customers lost power. The 175,000 outages to PPL customers was the second worst on record only surpassed by Hurricane Floyd. Huge trees snapped like twigs and even utility poles snapped. Thousands of trees were knocked down.  Entire sections of new lines, poles and transformers had to be replaced. The restoration process was hindered because many of the outages were in remote areas and the smaller roads were not plowed. In addition, trees continued to fall through the weekend (28th and 29th) and created new outages. Repair crews from as far away as Maryland, New York and western Pennsylvania helped with the restoration process. Entire sections of Interstates 80, 81, 84 and 380 were closed. Interstate 80 was closed at the New Jersey State border. In Carbon County, a state of emergency was declared on Christmas Day and was not lifted until December 29th. Twice the county had to hand emergency response calls to Monroe County. All fire department and ambulance personnel were placed on stand-by. Power was restored for good at the county emergency services during the evening of the 27th. Shelters were opened in five Carbon County townships. Many people resorted to placing snow in their refrigerators to keep food cold and melting snow on stove tops to flush toilets. U.S. Route 209 was closed between Lansford and Nesquehoning because of downed trees. Businesses in Jim Thorpe were closed through the 28th. About 31,000 Carbon County residents lost power. The number was down to 7,700 the evening of the 27th and 1,400 the evening of the 29th (all in the Panther Valley). Power was completely restored on the 30th. In Monroe County, the southern and western parts of the county were hit the hardest. About 16,000 county residents lost power. All power was restored on the 27th with the last restoration in the Pocono Wild Haven Estate in Wooddale. Many vehicles were abandoned and left on roadways. Many roads were impassable during the height of the storm. All county offices were closed on the 26th. The 21 inches of snow in Tobyhanna was a one day December record.  In Berks County 30,000 homes and businesses lost power, two-thirds of them in Reading. Other hard hit municipalities were Sinking Spring, Cumru, Hamburg, Fleetwood and Oley. Several shelters were opened throughout the county. The Red Cross also sent people without power to hotels. All power was restored by the morning of the 29th. Two men in the county died shoveling snow. One was a 57-year-old in Muhlenberg Township and the other was a 78-year-old in Sinking Spring. In the Lehigh Valley, Interstate 78 was plagued with vehicles stuck in snow. There were multiple minor collisions on U.S. Route 22 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 33 and 248. About 5,600 homes and businesses lost power in the valley mainly in Allentown, Emmaus, Salisbury and South Whitehall Townships. In the Philadelphia suburbs the quick accumulation of snow led to many accidents. Vehicles were unable to ascend hills and many slipped and slid into ditches. By the middle of the afternoon there were over 100 reported accidents in Bucks County. Strong winds and sleet forced the cancellation of the annual re-enactment of Washington crossing the Delaware River.  Specific accumulations included 21 inches in Tobyhanna (Monroe County), 19 inches in Albrightsville (Carbon County) and Blakeslee (Monroe County), 14.8 inches in Pocono Summit (Monroe County), 14 inches in Beltzville (Carbon County), 13 inches in Jim Thorpe (Carbon County) and Vinemont (Berks County), 12 inches in Mohnton (Berks County), 10.8 inches in East Stroudsburg (Monroe County), 10 inches in Honeybrook (Chester County), 8 inches in Morgantown (Berks County) and Schnecksville (Lehigh County), 7.5 inches in Perkasie (Bucks County), 7.4 inches in Williams Township (Northampton County), 7.2 inches at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 7 inches in Reading (Berks County), 6.6 inches in Bath (Northampton County), 6 inches in Easton (Northampton County), 5.2 inches in Glenmoore (Chester County), 4.9 inches in Palm (Montgomery County), 4.8 inches in Doylestown (Bucks County), 3.0 inches in Southampton (Bucks County), 2.7 inches in Green Lane (Montgomery County) and 1 inch in Valley Forge (Chester County)The northeaster that produced the tidal flooding moved from Mississippi the morning of the 24th to near Norfolk the morning of the 25th to just west of Atlantic City during the afternoon of the 25th to south of Nova Scotia the morning of the 26th.",,"PDS"

Wind gusts reports in the 60-80 mph range were common throughout the day across the entire region, with a few gusts near 100 mph.  Remote wind sensors along the Sierra Crest measured wind gusts in excess of 130 mph. Strongest winds occurred just before the cold front moved into the area at about 5:30 p.m.  Literally hundreds of trees and thousands of tree limbs were blown down across the region.  In addition, there was widespread damage to roofs, fences, commercial billboards and signs, and power lines.  Numerous power outages occurred, some lasting for several days after the event in rural areas.   In Carson City, the entire roof of an apartment building was torn off by wind gusts estimated at 90 mph.   Across much of western Nevada, blowing dust and debris created near zero visibilities at times, resulting in temporary closures of highways in Mineral, Lyon, Pershing and Churchill counties.   A few relatively minor traffic accidents resulted from the low visibilities.  Several tractor-trailer rigs were also blown off highways or blown over by the strong winds.  From these accidents, a few minor injuries were reported but fortunately no serious injuries or deaths were reported.  The regional electric utility lost 140 power poles and 18 transmission line due to the strong winds, with damages and repair costs estimated at over $3M.

The storm dramatically deepened as it tracked northeast along the atlantic coast and reached just south of eastern Long Island by late Christmas night. With plenty of cold polar air in place, the stage was set for a record breaking snowstorm across eastern New York, the biggest snowstorm since the Superstorm of 93. The snow began in earnest before midday across the Catskills and Mohawk Valley, and overspread the remainder of eastern New York by the afternoon. During the late day and evening hours, snowfall rates averaged 1 to 3 inches per hour while an intense narrow band, with rates up to 5 inches per hour, set up across Southern Herkimer and Montgomery counties. The bulk of the crippling snowstorm fell in about a 15 hour period, winding down a little after midnight on December 26. A little sleet mixed in across the Hudson Valley during the early portions of the storm, but snow was the primary precipitation type. Snowfall amounts ranged from nearly 3 feet across portions of the Mohawk Valley and extreme southern Herkimer County, to about 2 feet in the Capital District and around a foot or less well south from Poughkeepsie south, and from Glens Falls north. There was a sharp cutoff where the accumulating snow fell across northern Herkimer and northern Hamilton counties, but the majority of population in both these counties were still impacted by 7 or more inches of snow.  A few specific snowfall amounts included 21.0 inches at Albany in Albany County, 8.8 inches at Beacon, Dutchess County, 25.0 inches at Niskayuna, Schenectady County and 23 inches at Cobleskill, in Schoharie County. The maximum amount reported from this storm was 34.0 inches in Cedarville, in southern Herkimer County. The 19.2 inches of snow that fell on Christmas Day easily smashed the 13.8 inch Christmas day record previously set in 1978. It was the ninth greatest snowstorm in Albany's history. Not only did the snow come down at a furious clip, but 15 to 30 mph wind gusts produced some blowing and drifting of the snow and travel was next to impossible during the height of the storm. Near blizzard conditions were noted across the higher terrain, where winds briefly gusted to 50 mph.  Many vehicular accidents were reported and many vehicles became stuck or went off roadways. At one point, the New York State Thruway was closed between the cities of Catskill and Syracuse. Many other roads like Highway 5S were closed as well as all county roads in Schenectady County. A general state of emergency was declared in portions of Herkimer, Montgomery and Schenectady counties. Ninety five percent of the flights were cancelled out of Albany International Airport, stranding many at the airport through Christmas night. A transformer malfunction left 2,600 customers in the dark in the Ballston Spa area with spotty power outages noted elsewhere.

Roads and sidewalks became treacherous and numerous trees and power lines were downed by the heavy ice accumulations.  Across Central and Western Maryland, 38,000 customers lost power as a direct result of the storm. In Frederick County, two men died from carbon monoxide poisoning in their Libertytown home. A gas-powered electric generator that was turned on in response to a 3 day power outage was blamed for the deaths.  In Howard County, 22 people were treated in emergency rooms for slip and fall injures related to the ice.  In Anne Arundel County, 8 slip and fall injuries were reported.  In Prince George's and Anne Arundel counties, ice accumulations were held to less than one quarter of an inch because temperatures rose above freezing by mid-morning.

In Howard County, 22 people were treated in emergency rooms for slip and fall injures related to the ice.  In Anne Arundel County, 8 slip and fall injuries were reported.  In Prince George's and Anne Arundel counties, ice accumulations were held to less than one quarter of an inch because temperatures rose above freezing by mid-morning. A few icy patches were reported on roads and sidewalks during the morning hours. In Baltimore and Harford counties, a combination of heavy rainfall and melting snow caused minor flooding on roads during the afternoon and evening of the 11th.",,"PDS"

There were three primary episodes of precipitation in December, the first a two-day storm on the 9th and 10th.  With less than an inch and a half accumulation at any one location over the period, flooding problems were not an issue.  However, the rainfall totals helped to further saturate the soil.  The next and by far most serious storm episode begin on the 13th of the month and lasted on and off through the 21st.  A very strong and moist jet stream developed across the Pacific Ocean and brought a series of storms into California.  Wave after wave of locally heavy rain pounded the north bay counties for days.  Flooding became a serious issue, not just for urban and small stream flooding, but for mainstem flooding as well.  Flood warnings were issued for the Russian and Napa rivers and the forecast points along these rivers reached flood stage on the 16th and 17th of the month.  With a flood stage of 19 feet, the Healdsburg gauge on the Russian River crested at 19.56 feet.  With a flood stage of 32 feet, the Guerneville gauge on the Russian River crested at 33.57 feet.  With a flood stage of 13 feet, the St. Helena gauge on the Napa River crested at 15.47 feet.  With a flood stage of 25 feet, the Napa gauge on the Napa River crested at 26.44 feet.  Most of the mainstem flooding was minor in nature but there were areas of moderate flooding, mostly agricultural land.    The last storm  episode occurred from the 28th to the 31st.  These storms appeared to have the development to create serious flooding problems and because of that flood warnings were issued for the mainstems of the Russian and Napa rivers.  The jet stream that set up actually drove these storms further north than expected and the possible flooding over the north bay counties never materialized as serious as believed.  A good 2 to 4 inches of rain did fall over the area during that time with the most significant amounts over the coastal mountains.  Urban and small stream flooding did occur and there was great concern for possible mudslides due to the saturation of the soil.  Historically, December 2002 became the 6th wettest in downtown San Francisco, our most well known location, since records began in 1849.  The total of 12.03 inches was 378% of normal and accounted for 54% of the total seasonal rainfall for that location.

The precipitation type ranged from mostly freezing rain along the Tennessee border to mostly snow at Henderson and Owensboro. Ice accumulations in some of the Tennessee border counties were between one and two inches, causing widespread power outages and downed tree limbs. Further north, places from Paducah to Madisonville received several inches of snow, topped by around one half inch of ice accumulation. Northernmost counties, including the Owensboro and Henderson areas, received about 4 inches of snow and one quarter inch of ice. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week. Travel was heavily impacted by the winter storm. Hundreds of vehicle accidents occurred, including a couple with fatalities (indirect storm fatalities). One man was killed when his vehicle crossed the median and hit a semi on the Pennyrile Parkway near the Henderson/Webster County line. Two men were killed when their van overturned on Interstate 24 at the U.S. 45 interchange near Paducah. In the Tennessee border area, especially Fulton, Hickman, Carlisle, southern Graves, and southern Marshall Counties, power was not fully restored for four days. Carlisle County officials estimated 80 percent of the county was without power. Several counties established shelters for those without power. A local utility company reported this was the worst ice storm since 1983, with thousands of downed trees and limbs. Many of the tree limbs landed across roadways.  A large tree limb fell through a house in Mayfield, causing damage to a bedroom. The winter storm began during the early morning hours and ended late the following night.",,"PDS"

With plenty of cold polar air in place, the stage was set for a record breaking snowstorm across eastern New York, the biggest snowstorm since the Superstorm of 93. The snow began in earnest before midday across the Catskills and Mohawk Valley, and overspread the remainder of eastern New York by the afternoon. During the late day and evening hours, snowfall rates averaged 1 to 3 inches per hour while an intense narrow band, with rates up to 5 inches per hour, set up across Southern Herkimer and Montgomery counties. The bulk of the crippling snowstorm fell in about a 15 hour period, winding down a little after midnight on December 26. A little sleet mixed in across the Hudson Valley during the early portions of the storm, but snow was the primary precipitation type. Snowfall amounts ranged from nearly 3 feet across portions of the Mohawk Valley and extreme southern Herkimer County, to about 2 feet in the Capital District and around a foot or less well south from Poughkeepsie south, and from Glens Falls north.

The maximum amount reported from this storm was 34.0 inches in Cedarville, in southern Herkimer County. The 19.2 inches of snow that fell on Christmas Day easily smashed the 13.8 inch Christmas day record previously set in 1978. It was the ninth greatest snowstorm in Albany's history. Not only did the snow come down at a furious clip, but 15 to 30 mph wind gusts produced some blowing and drifting of the snow and travel was next to impossible during the height of the storm. Near blizzard conditions were noted across the higher terrain, where winds briefly gusted to 50 mph.  Many vehicular accidents were reported and many vehicles became stuck or went off roadways.

The storm dramatically deepened as it tracked northeast along the atlantic coast and reached just south of eastern Long Island by late Christmas night. With plenty of cold polar air in place, the stage was set for a record breaking snowstorm across eastern New York, the biggest snowstorm since the Superstorm of 93. The snow began in earnest before midday across the Catskills and Mohawk Valley, and overspread the remainder of eastern New York by the afternoon. During the late day and evening hours, snowfall rates averaged 1 to 3 inches per hour while an intense narrow band, with rates up to 5 inches per hour, set up across Southern Herkimer and Montgomery counties. The bulk of the crippling snowstorm fell in about a 15 hour period, winding down a little after midnight on December 26. A little sleet mixed in across the Hudson Valley during the early portions of the storm, but snow was the primary precipitation type. Snowfall amounts ranged from nearly 3 feet across portions of the Mohawk Valley and extreme southern Herkimer County, to about 2 feet in the Capital District and around a foot or less well south from Poughkeepsie south, and from Glens Falls north. There was a sharp cutoff where the accumulating snow fell across northern Herkimer and northern Hamilton counties, but the majority of population in both these counties were still impacted by 7 or more inches of snow.

A pilot and Police Officers Vince Babauta and Michael Camacho flying in a helicopter spotted Yury floating in the waters north of the Groto. He was waving his hands to show that he was fine. Notified about the victim's location, the officers on harbor patrol rescued him at 1756. Yury told police the he and his friend, Andrei Dorosuen, went to the Grotto to dive around 1245. Yury said that when he exited the cave at the Grotto, the current was so strong it caused him and Dorosuen to seperate. He said that he was dragged so he decided to just float with the current. Yury said he tried to swim back to the Grotto, but failed so he relaxed hoping that help would come. Dorosuen said he waited for Yury for 20 minutes before he got out from the water and rushed to Sting Ray Dive Shop to report the incident. The dive shop called the Department of Public Safety Unit at 1600. Yury suffered minor scratches on his arms and legs.",,"PDS"

Around 6 inches of snow fell in the greater Boston area, with 2 to 5 inches in Bristol and Plymouth Counties.The weight of the snow, combined with strong northeast winds, brought down trees and power lines throughout much of Worcester County and the Merrimack Valley.  About 29,000 customers lost power in these areas during the height of the storm, many on the northern end of Interstate 495.  High winds were reported in the immediate Boston area and also on Nantucket.

During the first few hours at any given location the snow fell at an inch or two per hour rate.  Due to the heavy snow and temperatures dropping below freezing travel became extremely difficult.  Numerous accidents were reported across northeast Oklahoma and several included injuries.  One accident around midday on the 23rd resulted in a death about 8 miles east of Ponca City in Osage county. In addition to the difficult travel the snow caused some tree limbs to fall onto power lines producing a few power outages.  As many as 13,000 customers in Owasso and eastern part of the city of Tulsa experienced an interruption of electric service.  Four to five hundred customers scatterred around Ottawa, Craig, Delaware and Mayes counties also suffered power outages. The snow began to taper off from west to east during the late afternoon and early evening hours of the 23rd.  However,  the snow began again during the late evening hours of the 23rd and the early morning hours of the 24th.  This snow lasted into the morning hours of the 24th.  Although the snow during the nighttime period was not as heavy as that during the previous afternoon another one to three inches of snow accumulated.

That night, the storm intensified as it moved northeast, reaching the Virginia coastline by daybreak on December 25th. Around this time, spotty drizzle and light rain along with a few pockets of light freezing rain began to overspread northeast New Jersey. As the morning progressed, the center of low pressure started to track northeast over the Atlantic along a path that hugged the coast. As a result, a steady rain began to fall over northeast New Jersey, and all of the freezing rain and drizzle changed over to plain rain. Early that afternoon, the rain began to change to snow from west to east across the region, as the storm started to move east of the tri-state area allowing the winds to shift to the north. By 3 pm, the entire area had changed over to all snow. During the late afternoon, narrow bands of heavy snow developed and moved over parts of the region, which accounted for the large ranges of snowfall with this storm. As the center of the storm continued to move northeast away from the area, the snow then tapered off to light snow and flurries during the evening, before ending around midnight. Snowfall amounts over northeast New Jersey ranged from 3 to 4 inches in some spots to as much as 8 to 12 inches in other locations. The heavier snowfall amounts generally occurred away from the urban areas, with the highest amounts over the northern portions of Passaic and Bergen Counties.",,"PDS"

Tank Farm FireFire at Mobil tank farm at the commercial port at Cabras Island. It is believed that static electricity inside on of the tanks may have been the cause of the fire. During the height of the storm a tank of unleaded gasoline caught fire. Static electricity may have occurred inside the tank due to friction caused by extremly high winds rushing through the ventilation system. The tank that first caught fire contained less than 15 percent of its total capacity of unleaded gasoline when the fire erupted.

During the first few hours at any given location the snow fell at an inch or two per hour rate.  Due to the heavy snow and temperatures dropping below freezing travel became extremely difficult.  Numerous accidents were reported across northeast Oklahoma and several included injuries.  One accident around midday on the 23rd resulted in a death about 8 miles east of Ponca City in Osage county. In addition to the difficult travel the snow caused some tree limbs to fall onto power lines producing a few power outages.  As many as 13,000 customers in Owasso and eastern part of the city of Tulsa experienced an interruption of electric service.  Four to five hundred customers scatterred around Ottawa, Craig, Delaware and Mayes counties also suffered power outages. The snow began to taper off from west to east during the late afternoon and early evening hours of the 23rd.  However,  the snow began again during the late evening hours of the 23rd and the early morning hours of the 24th.  This snow lasted into the morning hours of the 24th.  Although the snow during the nighttime period was not as heavy as that during the previous afternoon another one to three inches of snow accumulated.

This mix changed back to snow on Christmas Day and dropped up to around one foot of snow across northwest New Jersey. Precipitation began as light snow toward midnight on Christmas Eve. As the northeaster moved northeast along the eastern seaboard, warmer air from the Atlantic and the south warmed the air between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above ground level. This changed precipitation over to sleet and freezing rain.Then as warmer air moved in near the ground precipitation changed to plain rain across much of northern New Jersey by 9 a.m. EST on Christmas Day. The only exception was in Sussex County where most temperatures remained below freezing. Around two-tenths of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. The northeaster was in the process of intensifying rapidly along the Middle Atlantic seaboard and both its precipitation intensity and coverage increased rapidly across the state during the second half of the morning. In fact, a SKYWARN Spotter in Sussex County reported a thundersleet storm from 1040 a.m. through 1055 a.m. EST on Christmas morning. As precipitation intensity increased and winds started to shift from the northeast to north, precipitation started to change to all snow. This began in Sussex County between 11 a.m. and Noon EST and moved southeast during the afternoon across the rest of the northern half of the state. Precipitation changed back to snow around 1 p.m. EST in Somerville (Somerset County) and Trenton (Mercer County) and between 3 and 5 p.m. EST in Monmouth County. The heaviest snow fell during the afternoon and lessened in intensity during the evening. The snow ended around Midnight Christmas night.Most travelers made plans around the storm and while there were accidents, no major congestion was reported. The worst reported traveling problems were along Interstate 78 in Warren County, Interstate 287 in Morris County and eastbound Interstate 280 which was down to one lane along the Morris/Essex county border because the other lanes buckled and collapsed. With respect to the snow, the worst problems were in Sussex County where the combination of ice and then heavy wet snow snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Several vehicles also skidded into utility poles. About 7,000 Jersey Central Power and Light customers lost power in northern New Jersey. The number was down to 650 the morning of the 26th.

Around this time, spotty drizzle and light rain along with a few pockets of light freezing rain began to overspread northeast New Jersey. As the morning progressed, the center of low pressure started to track northeast over the Atlantic along a path that hugged the coast. As a result, a steady rain began to fall over northeast New Jersey, and all of the freezing rain and drizzle changed over to plain rain. Early that afternoon, the rain began to change to snow from west to east across the region, as the storm started to move east of the tri-state area allowing the winds to shift to the north. By 3 pm, the entire area had changed over to all snow. During the late afternoon, narrow bands of heavy snow developed and moved over parts of the region, which accounted for the large ranges of snowfall with this storm. As the center of the storm continued to move northeast away from the area, the snow then tapered off to light snow and flurries during the evening, before ending around midnight.

Much of the island had to endure a long period in the storm's eye wall since the storm was moving slow, about 10 miles per hour .Maximum sustained wind at the National Weather Service Office was 105 mph from the West at 1826 on the 8th. highest reported gust was 115 mph from the North at 1508. Wind may have been stronger, but unrecorded since tower which sensor was on blew down.At Andersen Air Force Base the estimated maximum sustained wind was 115 mph from theNorth at 1459.

Sea wall heavily damaged at the Paseo Park in Hagatna and at western coastal locations along Marine Drive.Flooding on Guam...minor at some low lying locations. Central Rivers ran very high with record streamflows at the Pago River (East side) and Asan River (West side).There was extensive flooding in several villages. Major damage throughout the norther two-thirds of GuamHospitalWinds from the typhoon collapsed the walls at Guam Memorial Hospital. The medical telemetry unit, pediatrics, the Intensive Care Unit and the Respiratory Unit were shut down because of the collapse of the wall. No injuries were sustained at the hospital. 300 people were brought to the hospital for storm related injuries.One death was related to the typhoon. An elderly woman was cut badly during the peak of the storm and apparently went into cardiac arrest. 71 years old. HotelsSeveral people reportedly were injured at the Outrigger Guam Resort, near the upper-level floors where travel agent offices are located. The metal security gate that separated the hotel from the entertainment and restaurant complex next door fell during the early part of the storm, causing injuries, and windows at the travel agencies blew in, cutting people with glass. A doctor was found in the hotel to treat the injured. The ceiling in the bridge between the Outrigger and Sam Choy's Restaurant partially collapsed. Several rooms were flooded, the outside walls of two rooms on the eighth and ninth floors were ripped out by the storm. The Guam Marriot Resort had damage to the lobby and two restaurants . The Hilton Hotel in Tumon suffered millions in damage as many rooms were flooded, walls cracked and the executive lounge in the Magalahi Tower was wrecked as strong typhoon winds destroyed the typhoon-proof windows. Tank Farm FireFire at Mobil tank farm at the commercial port at Cabras Island. It is believed that static electricity inside on of the tanks may have been the cause of the fire. During the height of the storm a tank of unleaded gasoline caught fire. Static electricity may have occurred inside the tank due to friction caused by extremly high winds rushing through the ventilation system. The tank that first caught fire contained less than 15 percent of its total capacity of unleaded gasoline when the fire erupted. The explosion sent the tank's lid airborne, and it landed more than six hundred feet northeast of the tank.By the 9th the fire had already destroyed two other nearby tanks. A third tank had ignited by the heat of the other fires. A fourth by the 10th. One was a jet fuel tank, one gasoline and a third diesel.The fire was extremely hot, the tanks were close together and low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts. The fire was finally put out on the 13th around 1600. ChurchesThe Santa Teresita Catholic Church in Mangilao sustained extensive damage. The wind ripped apart a chunk of tin sheets from metal beams and blew in a huge glass windows. The roof blew off St. Jude's Church in Sinajana. the roof of the Ordot-Chalan Pago chuch also blew away. AirportDamage to navigation equipment. 65 percent of the metal security fence surround the airport was pushed over by the typhoon force winds. A Continental Airline hanger at Guam's International Airport had its roof damaged.Storm Damage on Guam was estimated at $73 million.  Utilities and Roads$52 million worth of damage to the power system with $47 million worth occurring to power poles, lines and transformers.

Motorist familiar with the area said the rivers overflowed and caused the pavement to be ripped off sections of those roads. Sand and gravel from the beach washed onto Marine Drive in East Hagatna.SchoolsTwo walls at Vincent Benavente Middle School were damaged. The second floor of Father Duenas Memorial School's main building were damaged. Much of the roof was torn from metal beams. Rain pouring in the after the roof was gone flooded parts of the interior of the school.

The precipitation type ranged from mostly freezing rain along the Tennessee border to mostly snow at Henderson and Owensboro. Ice accumulations in some of the Tennessee border counties were between one and two inches, causing widespread power outages and downed tree limbs. Further north, places from Paducah to Madisonville received several inches of snow, topped by around one half inch of ice accumulation. Northernmost counties, including the Owensboro and Henderson areas, received about 4 inches of snow and one quarter inch of ice. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week. Travel was heavily impacted by the winter storm. Hundreds of vehicle accidents occurred, including a couple with fatalities (indirect storm fatalities). One man was killed when his vehicle crossed the median and hit a semi on the Pennyrile Parkway near the Henderson/Webster County line. Two men were killed when their van overturned on Interstate 24 at the U.S. 45 interchange near Paducah. In the Tennessee border area, especially Fulton, Hickman, Carlisle, southern Graves, and southern Marshall Counties, power was not fully restored for four days. Carlisle County officials estimated 80 percent of the county was without power. Several counties established shelters for those without power. A local utility company reported this was the worst ice storm since 1983, with thousands of downed trees and limbs. Many of the tree limbs landed across roadways.  A large tree limb fell through a house in Mayfield, causing damage to a bedroom. The winter storm began during the early morning hours and ended late the following night.",,"PDS"

The low pressure center then slowly moved north along the coast, reaching Cape Cod by late November 17. At the same time, a shallow layer of arctic air bled south from eastern Canada. The air was cold enough to produce a heavy wintery mix of precipitation during a good portion of the storm across eastern New York. Initially, the precipitation fell as snow, or snow and sleet mixed. A 1-3 inch swath of snow was observed from about Albany southward. A 3-6 inch swath of snow fell north of Albany. As warmer air worked in aloft, the snow changed to sleet, then freezing rain. Freezing rain was more extensive south of Albany, where up to 58,000 customers lost power in the Mid Hudson Valley. Ice accretion was between one-half and one inch. Western Ulster County was especially hard hit where in addition to the ice, winds frequently gusted to 30 mph and, with lingering leaves on the trees, brought many trees and power lines down. Further north, the combination of snow, sleet and freezing rain still caused up to 1,000 customers in the Lake George Saratoga region to loose power, and spotty power losses elsewhere in the Capital District. In addition, there was a loss of significant limbs on trees and dangerous travel conditions. As warmer air worked in, temperatures finally reached above the freezing mark across the region, putting an end to the winter precipitation on Sunday morning. However, on the back side of the storm, additional snow fell. While these additional accumulations were relatively minor, the snow did produce tricky travel again late Sunday into early Monday.
