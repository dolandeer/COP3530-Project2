However, plentiful solar insolation/surface heating in the vicinity of a dryline fostered widely scattered thunderstorm development by the late afternoon. Strong instability and sufficient organizing wind shear lead to a few of these storms displaying supercellular characteristics and producing reports of large hail initially, owing to steep lapse rates and weak low-level shear (among other factors already mentioned). By the mid-evening, as low-level shear and storm-scale interactions began to increase, a few tornadoes occurred across portions of south-central into southwest Oklahoma. The most significant of these was an EF-1 tornado near the community of Hollister (Tillman County).","Frederick Municipal Airport (KFDR) observation.","CSV"

A good portion of the South Plains did see sunshine and mild temperatures during the afternoon, but that quickly changed that night as colder air moved in behind a backdoor cold front. Immediately in advance of the colder air, a broken line of non-severe thunderstorms formed over the southern Rolling Plains but quickly shifted off to the east. Behind the cold front temperatures dipped into the lower 30s and upper 20s during the early morning hours of the 11th just as precipitation expanded in coverage and intensity. The rain changed to snow from northwest to southeast across the South Plains and Rolling Plains as the colder air moved in. The exception was across the far southern Rolling Plains, around Stonewall and Kent Counties, where temperatures remained mild enough to keep the precipitation a cold rain. The snow, heavy at times, continued through much of the day for the South Plains, southern Texas Panhandle, and northern and central Rolling Plains, before finally diminishing from west to east in the evening as the upper level system shifted off into Oklahoma and North Texas.

In concert with robust kinematics in place, extreme instability (pockets of >4000-5000 J/kg of CAPE) promoted an environment favorable for significant severe weather.

In all, 32 tornadoes affected portions of the WFO Norman Forecast Area, the third most in a single day during the period of reliable record. This included six significant (EF-2+) tornadoes and one violent (EF-4) tornado that struck Marietta (Love County). ||Synoptically, a slow-moving and deep mid/upper-level wave progressed across the Four Corners region during the day. At the surface, an area of low-pressure strengthened/deepened across southwest Kansas, with a trailing dryline extending near and just west of the 100th meridian through much of the day. As ascent overspread this feature, numerous (organized) severe thunderstorms developed across the WFO Norman Forecast Area, even by as early as daybreak/early morning hours. The boundary layer was characterized by strong instability and wind shear, favorable for an organized/supercell storm mode. Initial supercells across western Oklahoma produced a few reports of large hail and the first (brief) tornadoes of the event just after 10 AM. Supercell storm development continued across portions of the area, focusing along an axis from western-north Texas into north-central Oklahoma through much of the afternoon. The first significant (EF-2) tornado of the event impacted the eastern edge of Knox City (Knox County, Texas) just after 3 PM. Through the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) organized and swept across much of southern/central Oklahoma and adjacent north Texas. Numerous mesovortex-type tornadoes developed and impacted the aforementioned areas. Ahead of the main convective line, strong warm air advection, driven by an increasing (45-60 knot) low-level jet, promoted the development of pre-frontal/line supercell thunderstorms. Multiple of these storms became strongly tornadic, producing multiple strong and long-tracking tornadoes. This included an EF-2 tornado impacting the western portions of Ardmore, an EF-3 tornado making a direct impact on the historic downtown district and adjacent neighborhoods in Sulphur, an EF-3 tornado traversing western portions of Hughes County, just west of Holdenville, and an EF-4 tornado destroying a Dollar Tree distribution center and nearby large retail stores on the western side of Marietta. The latter three tornadoes resulted in fatalities (1 in Sulphur, 2 near Holdenville and 1 in Marietta) along with additional injuries. ||Beyond severe weather outcomes, a significant flash flooding event occurred from the late evening of the 27th through mid-morning of the 28th. The corridor of highest rainfall, with observed 24-hour totals of 5-to-8 inches, occurred across portions of south-central into southeast Oklahoma, on the heels of a cluster of significant tornado impacts earlier in the evening.

A weak surface low was moving into SE Missouri during the morning with a secondary low located further northwest. A warm frontal boundary was draped across our area. A bowing line progressed east across SE Missouri into W Kentucky and far S Illinois between 0500-1000CST, followed by a mostly sub-severe second line that exited the region by 1300CST. The environment recovered producing fuel for more severe storms, starting with supercells 1800-2100CST with a line of storms moving east-southeastward across the entire Quad State after 1900CST, crossing through by midnight. Across the Quad State, this event produced the record for most tornado track miles in a single day in office history, along with the second most warnings issued in a day (just behind the May 8, 2024 event). Widespread straight-line wind and tornado damage resulted in over 100,000 customers without power across the Quad State.||For the morning, MLCAPE values at 0700CST were 1000-2000 J/kg in W Kentucky. Effective bulk shear was 30-40 kts with STP around 1, which increased in the following hours. Precipitable water was 1.5-1.8 inches, allowing for torrential rainfall rates.||The morning round of storms produced widespread destructive straight-line wind damage leading to numerous power outages across the southernmost portions of W Kentucky from the Jackson Purchase Area to the Southern Pennyrile. Two EF-1 tornadoes occurred in Calloway County, with one of them tracking 22 miles. One person was injured when thunderstorm winds caused a tree to fall on his vehicle on Rockwood Rd in Calloway County. Two more tornadoes formed in Trigg County, one an EF-1, and an EF-2 that produced its strongest damage south of Hopkinsville in Christian County. Another EF-1 tornado formed northwest of Bremen and tracked northeastward to Island in McLean County. Torrential rainfall rates led to a few reports of flash flooding in Western Kentucky during the morning to early afternoon hours. ||Heading into the evening, MLCAPE values at 1800CST were 2000-3500 J/kg in W Kentucky. For W Kentucky, effective bulk shear rose to 45-55 kts, with SRH around 200-400 m2/s2 and STP of 2-4. 0-1 km shear was 20-30 kts. Mid-level lapse rates were 7-7.5 C/km. DCAPE of 1100-1400 J/kg provided ample opportunity for downburst winds.||Late afternoon to early evening supercells produced hail reports and a long-track EF-3 tornado that began in Lyon County, then continued east-northeastward through Caldwell and Hopkins Counties. Severe structural damage occurred between Dawson Springs and Charleston and at least one family in Barnsley lost their home for the second time with the previous instance being the historic December 10, 2021 tornado. 21 people were injured (4 in Caldwell, 17 in Hopkins) while two people lost their lives, one in Hopkins County from the tornado (48f, direct), and one in Caldwell County due to a heart attack while cleaning up tornado debris (54m, indirect). The cold front swept through, producing more straight-line wind damage and flash flooding. As the line caught up to the supercell tornado, the storm became much more muddled, with an EF-1 tornado taking shape in Muhlenberg County tracking southeastward through Beech Creek and Beechmont, and continuing as a long track tornado reaching areas north of Bowling Green. Late night power outages were widespread along the tornado tracks in Lyon, Hopkins, Caldwell, and Muhlenberg Counties, which other counties with around half the county without power included Calloway, Trigg, Christian, and Todd Counties.

For W Kentucky, effective bulk shear rose to 45-55 kts, with SRH around 200-400 m2/s2 and STP of 2-4. 0-1 km shear was 20-30 kts. Mid-level lapse rates were 7-7.5 C/km. DCAPE of 1100-1400 J/kg provided ample opportunity for downburst winds.||Late afternoon to early evening supercells produced hail reports and a long-track EF-3 tornado that began in Lyon County, then continued east-northeastward through Caldwell and Hopkins Counties. Severe structural damage occurred between Dawson Springs and Charleston and at least one family in Barnsley lost their home for the second time with the previous instance being the historic December 10, 2021 tornado. 21 people were injured (4 in Caldwell, 17 in Hopkins) while two people lost their lives, one in Hopkins County from the tornado (48f, direct), and one in Caldwell County due to a heart attack while cleaning up tornado debris (54m, indirect). The cold front swept through, producing more straight-line wind damage and flash flooding. As the line caught up to the supercell tornado, the storm became much more muddled, with an EF-1 tornado taking shape in Muhlenberg County tracking southeastward through Beech Creek and Beechmont, and continuing as a long track tornado reaching areas north of Bowling Green. Late night power outages were widespread along the tornado tracks in Lyon, Hopkins, Caldwell, and Muhlenberg Counties, which other counties with around half the county without power included Calloway, Trigg, Christian, and Todd Counties. Rainfall amounts of 2.5 to 4 inches were commonplace, with locally higher totals in southern Trigg and Christian Counties. Brief minor flooding occurred for the third time this month on part of the S. Fork Little River near Hopkinsville.","Hail as large as tennis balls or baseballs was estimated to have fallen in Farmersville.","CSV"

Initially, a few isolated supercells storms developed and produced some tornadoes. As this occurred, a line of storms also developed and eventually pushed eastward across our region. Widespread damaging winds occurred with the line along with numerous tornadoes. This particular convective system was extremely efficient at producing tornadoes. This resulted in a record number of tornadoes for the month of December. The total across our forecast area was 43. The previous December record was 24 back in 2022.","An EF-3 tornado touched down in southern Franklin County near Middleton Creek Road and moved northeast. Broad and sporadic wind damage in the area suggests the tornado was still consolidating in this area. As the tornado crossed Berryton Road, it had reached EF-3 intensity and destroyed the O'Zion Baptist Church there. Most walls were collapsed, but two people took shelter in the bathroom and were unharmed. Documents from the church including bank statements and cancelled checks were found as far away as Brandon, MS to the northeast. Several homes in the area were also damaged including roof damage to a home, and an unanchored mobile home which was rolled once. Both residents of the mobile home were injured, but had sought safety in the bathroom of the home after receiving the Tornado Warning alert on their phones. The tornado continued northeast and damaged tree and power lines along its path. It crossed through the McCall Creek and Lucien areas at US Highway 84 where a modular home lost significant portions of its roof. The tornado collapsed an electrical transmission line tower just west of the Lincoln County line south of Hunsucker Lane. The tornado continued northeast across multiple roads through northwest Lincoln County and damaged trees, power lines, and homes. It dissipated just north of Pleasant Ridge Road. The maximum wind speed was 140 mph.","CSV"

This EF1 tornado began just south of Route 18 east of Passaic. Some of the worst damage of the tornado affected a farm property, where one outbuilding collapsed, another had a garage door blown off, and multiple trees were damaged or uprooted. Large debris from the damaged property was blown well northeast, in some cases over 100 yards. The tornado tracked northeast, damaging a grove of trees to the south of SH 18 and producing minor damage to an outbuilding and mobile home on the north side of the highway. The tornado then tracked northeast to Route T, producing sporadic tree damage and some minor property damage. The damage track continues east-northeast along County Road 13004, with continued sporadic tree damage. One of the larger trees fell onto a residence, damaging the property as well as to power lines. Intermittent tree damage continues northeast to Route BB and County Road 13003, with more significant tree damage eastward along Sunset Drive just west of the Henry County line. Damage becomes more intermittent eastward into Henry County, with no damage observed a half mile past the county line. However, much of this area north of 400 Road in Henry County is inaccessible, so it is possible the tornado continued a short distance longer to the north or northeast of the end of the track.","CSV"

Shortwave troughs associated with the upper trough moved over Nebraska and Kansas. An Arctic cold front began moving across central and south central Nebraska during the early morning hours of January 11th. Snow started to develop and move across the area during the late morning and early afternoon hours of January 11th. The snow gradually ended from west to east beginning the morning of January 12th and continued into the afternoon hours. ||An upper trough over Canada and Montana plunged southward and moved over the Central Plains by the morning of January 13th. This trough brought a reinforcing shot of colder air along with stronger northerly winds gusting to 30 to 40 mph which continued on through the day on the 13th. Additional lift from this upper trough resulted in light snow during the night of January 12th and into the morning of January 13th. This resulted in additional blowing and drifting snow, and hazardous travel due to near-blizzard conditions.||This heavy snow event resulted in widespread road closures and school/activity cancellations, and even several business closures. The heaviest snow affected areas mainly along/east of Highway 281 and along/north of Highway 6, where totals reached 6-12 inches in spots. Amounts tapered off to closer to an inch for areas further west and south. The brunt of accumulating snow fell from mid-late afternoon on the 11th through around midday on the 12th, with north-northwest winds gusting to around 30-35 MPH. Grand Island tied the liquid equivalent precipitation and snowfall records. Hastings set new records for liquid equivalent precipitation, snowfall, and cold high temperature.||Along with county and rural roads, Highways 281, 4, 136, 78, 28, and 9 were considered impassable or closed outright due to near-blizzard conditions. While Interstate 80 was not closed, travel was discouraged by officials. Multiple counties pulled their plows off the roads during the worst of the conditions due to safety concerns. Several rescues were done on the morning of the 13th due to people being trapped in vehicles out in open areas. Due to the cumulative impacts across central and eastern Nebraska from the winter storm on January 8-9th and this one, the Governor of Nebraska declared a state of emergency, and the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency activated its Emergency Operations Center to coordinate efforts. Over the week, Nebraska Department of Transportation put in at least 35,000 man-hours, and even received some support from South Dakota. The Nebraska State Patrol responded to more than 1,200 stranded vehicles between the two storms across the region, close to 100 crashes, and over 400 motorist assists. Bitterly cold air and continued gusty winds brought dangerous wind chill values of -30 to -45 to the entire region for several days following the departure of this storm system.","Any additional snowfall during this period was light. A reinforcing push of northerly winds gusting between 35 and 45 MPH resulted in blowing and drifting of the snowfall from the 11-12th, causing poor visibility and hazardous conditions through the daytime hours on the 13th.","CSV"

Widespread snow totals of 4-8 inches, with locally higher amounts of 9-12 inches, were reported across the area, with the highest totals focused over areas east of Highway 183. Grand Island and Hastings both shattered the liquid equivalent precipitation and snowfall records for January 8th. Winds started to increase across the region during the evening on January 8th and into the overnight hours on January 9th which resulted in blizzard conditions. Northerly wind gusts of 40-45 MPH were common, with a few gusts over 50 MPH reported, including a gust of 52 MPH from the Hastings Airport ASOS. Temperatures dropped into the teens during the overnight period with wind chill values dropping into the negative single digits. Winds began to decrease from west to east during the day on January 9th. ||The heavy snow and strong winds resulted in near white-out to blizzard conditions, prompting widespread road closures, as well as school and event cancellations. A light wintry mix was reported ahead of the main snow event, also contributing to slick conditions across the area. Interstate 80 was closed in both directions by mid-afternoon on January 8th, and did not fully reopen until mid-afternoon on January 9th. Many area state and county highways also experienced closures. The Nebraska State Patrol reported over 300 weather related incidents across the entire area during this storm, including 310 motorist assists and 37 crashes. One accident the morning of January 8th resulted in one fatality and one injury near Lexington in Dawson County.","Snowfall amounts ranged from 3 to 6 inches across the county. Highest totals included the following: 5.8 inches, reported by a CoCoRaHS observer located eight miles south-southwest of Spalding; 5.5 inches, reported by the NWS Cooperative Observer located in Greeley; 4.0 inches, reported by a CoCoRaHS observer located four miles east of Scotia.","CSV"

Snow started to develop and move across the area during the late morning and early afternoon hours of January 11th. The snow gradually ended from west to east beginning the morning of January 12th and continued into the afternoon hours. ||An upper trough over Canada and Montana plunged southward and moved over the Central Plains by the morning of January 13th. This trough brought a reinforcing shot of colder air along with stronger northerly winds gusting to 30 to 40 mph which continued on through the day on the 13th. Additional lift from this upper trough resulted in light snow during the night of January 12th and into the morning of January 13th. This resulted in additional blowing and drifting snow, and hazardous travel due to near-blizzard conditions.||This heavy snow event resulted in widespread road closures and school/activity cancellations, and even several business closures. The heaviest snow affected areas mainly along/east of Highway 281 and along/north of Highway 6, where totals reached 6-12 inches in spots. Amounts tapered off to closer to an inch for areas further west and south. The brunt of accumulating snow fell from mid-late afternoon on the 11th through around midday on the 12th, with north-northwest winds gusting to around 30-35 MPH. Grand Island tied the liquid equivalent precipitation and snowfall records. Hastings set new records for liquid equivalent precipitation, snowfall, and cold high temperature.||Along with county and rural roads, Highways 281, 4, 136, 78, 28, and 9 were considered impassable or closed outright due to near-blizzard conditions. While Interstate 80 was not closed, travel was discouraged by officials. Multiple counties pulled their plows off the roads during the worst of the conditions due to safety concerns. Several rescues were done on the morning of the 13th due to people being trapped in vehicles out in open areas. Due to the cumulative impacts across central and eastern Nebraska from the winter storm on January 8-9th and this one, the Governor of Nebraska declared a state of emergency, and the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency activated its Emergency Operations Center to coordinate efforts. Over the week, Nebraska Department of Transportation put in at least 35,000 man-hours, and even received some support from South Dakota. The Nebraska State Patrol responded to more than 1,200 stranded vehicles between the two storms across the region, close to 100 crashes, and over 400 motorist assists.

Snow began during the day on January 8th across Nebraska and Kansas and started to decrease from west to east after midnight on January 9th and ended across the area during the day on the 9th. Widespread snow totals of 4-8 inches, with locally higher amounts of 9-12 inches, were reported across the area, with the highest totals focused over areas east of Highway 183. Grand Island and Hastings both shattered the liquid equivalent precipitation and snowfall records for January 8th. Winds started to increase across the region during the evening on January 8th and into the overnight hours on January 9th which resulted in blizzard conditions. Northerly wind gusts of 40-45 MPH were common, with a few gusts over 50 MPH reported, including a gust of 52 MPH from the Hastings Airport ASOS. Temperatures dropped into the teens during the overnight period with wind chill values dropping into the negative single digits. Winds began to decrease from west to east during the day on January 9th. ||The heavy snow and strong winds resulted in near white-out to blizzard conditions, prompting widespread road closures, as well as school and event cancellations. A light wintry mix was reported ahead of the main snow event, also contributing to slick conditions across the area. Interstate 80 was closed in both directions by mid-afternoon on January 8th, and did not fully reopen until mid-afternoon on January 9th. Many area state and county highways also experienced closures. The Nebraska State Patrol reported over 300 weather related incidents across the entire area during this storm, including 310 motorist assists and 37 crashes. One accident the morning of January 8th resulted in one fatality and one injury near Lexington in Dawson County.","Snowfall amounts ranged from 6 to 10 inches across the county, partially based off totals from surrounding counties. A local total of 6.0 inches was reported by a CoCoRaHS observer located six miles north of Aurora.","CSV"

The winds associated with this line of convectively enhanced snow showers were a lot stronger and resulted in a snow squall with white-out conditions. Wind gusts within the snow squall were frequently over 40 MPH, with a handful over 50 MPH. The Hastings Airport gusted to 59 MPH.||There was an accident west of Grand Island near the intersection of Highway 30 and Husker Highway involving at least 6 vehicles. Hall County Emergency Management stated that there were 10 accidents and 10-12 motorist assists across the county. Another pile-up, this one involving 18 vehicles in Adams County, occurred just southwest of Juniata near the intersection of Highway 6/34 and Liberty Avenue, with just one minor injury reported. Hamilton County Emergency Management noted there were multi-vehicle accidents which occurred on Highway 34 west of Aurora as well as on Highway 14, north of Interstate 80. There were several reports via social media of white-out conditions across the area with the passage of this snow squall.","","CSV"

As the month wore on (and as already noted above), the areal coverage of both D3/D2 diminished within North Central Kansas. In most affected locations, this was a one-category improvement, but for parts of mainly southeastern Rooks County it was actually a two-category improvement (from D3 to D1). As a result of these various improvements, the drought category situation at month's end stood as follows: 1) D3 now prevailed within mainly only parts of the western half of Rooks County (constituting only around 5% of the six-county domain)...2) A few splotches of D2 nicked at least small portions of all six counties (but now only comprising around 10% of the total area)...3) In response to the reduction of D3/D2, the areal coverage of D1 increased accordingly...now blanketing roughly 66% of North Central Kansas, and including the vast majority of Jewell, Osborne and Mitchell counties...4) the aforementioned zones of D0 and D-nothing within Phillips and Smith counties remained unchanged through the month (their combined areas still accounting for roughly 19% of the six-county area). ||Turning to January 2024 precipitation details, it was overall great news for the second consecutive month, as essentially all of North Central Kansas measured above normal monthly precipitation (meaning more than roughly 0.63), and roughly 10-15% of the domain boasted at least twice its January normal. Per 23 NWS and CoCoRaHS observers, some of the very-highest monthly tallies featured: 1.78 seven miles north-northeast of Natoma, 1.45 four miles west-northwest of Plainville, 1.30 in Smith Center and 1.23 nine miles east of Hunter.

Meanwhile, a few of the lowest (but still slightly above normal) January precipitation totals included: 0.69 at Lovewell Dam, 0.74 in Phillipsburg and 0.87 ten miles west-northwest of Stockton.

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap actually featured some of the most extreme conditions endured in three to four decades! The entire 24-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info). ||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following statistics are from ASOS observations at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island (GRI), where conditions were reasonably representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 1.1 F (average daily high temperature 9.5 /average daily low -7.4). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -4.7). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.6 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 12-36 F below normal. Six of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 10 F (as cold as -3 on the 14th), and seven of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -17 on the 14th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Turning to hourly temperature data from the Grand Island ASOS, it registered TEMPERATURES AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR AN INCREDIBLE 90-STRAIGHT HOURS between the evening of the 12th and the late morning of the 16th...the longest streak in 40 winters (since a 202-hour run in Dec. 1983)! Looking beyond Grand Island to other South Central Nebraska NWS Cooperative Observer sites and airport sensors, some of the very coldest readings reported during this stretch were -21 at Red Cloud and Greeley, and -20 in/near Central City, York and Genoa. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of the 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when dozens of automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -45 F.  A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by ASOS/AWOS/Nebraska Mesonet stations included -46 at Ord airport, -43 at Aurora airport, -42 near Gothenburg and -41 at Hastings airport along with near Alda and Central City. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -10 and -20 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However. on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, at the Grand Island ASOS (GRI), meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 3.6 F ABOVE normal...marking the 7th-warmest winter on record out of 129. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three-month season would have averaged around 2.6 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across South Central Nebraska in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 7-16 inches between the 8th-18th (highest along/east of Highway 281), with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Osceola accumulated 18.5 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in over 50 years...since Dec. 1973! Please refer to separate episode/event narratives for more specific details regarding Jan. 2024 snow events. As for the bitter cold itself though, it did carry its own impacts, including contributing to a water pipe burst at the Central Community College campus in Hastings that flooded the basement of the Phelps Building.","The Aurora Airport AWOS recorded wind chills of -41 at 9:15 AM on January 13th and -43 at 2:15 AM on January 14th.","CSV"

In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across South Central Nebraska in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 7-16 inches between the 8th-18th (highest along/east of Highway 281), with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Osceola accumulated 18.5 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in over 50 years...since Dec. 1973! Please refer to separate episode/event narratives for more specific details regarding Jan. 2024 snow events.

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap actually featured some of the most extreme conditions endured in three to four decades! The entire 24-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info). ||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following statistics are from ASOS observations at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island (GRI), where conditions were reasonably representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 1.1 F (average daily high temperature 9.5 /average daily low -7.4). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -4.7). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.6 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 12-36 F below normal. Six of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 10 F (as cold as -3 on the 14th), and seven of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -17 on the 14th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Turning to hourly temperature data from the Grand Island ASOS, it registered TEMPERATURES AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR AN INCREDIBLE 90-STRAIGHT HOURS between the evening of the 12th and the late morning of the 16th...the longest streak in 40 winters (since a 202-hour run in Dec. 1983)! Looking beyond Grand Island to other South Central Nebraska NWS Cooperative Observer sites and airport sensors, some of the very coldest readings reported during this stretch were -21 at Red Cloud and Greeley, and -20 in/near Central City, York and Genoa. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of the 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when dozens of automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -45 F.  A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by ASOS/AWOS/Nebraska Mesonet stations included -46 at Ord airport, -43 at Aurora airport, -42 near Gothenburg and -41 at Hastings airport along with near Alda and Central City. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -10 and -20 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However. on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, at the Grand Island ASOS (GRI), meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 3.6 F ABOVE normal...marking the 7th-warmest winter on record out of 129. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three-month season would have averaged around 2.6 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across South Central Nebraska in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 7-16 inches between the 8th-18th (highest along/east of Highway 281), with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow.

This brought plenty of warm air and diurnal instability to the area ahead of a cold front, which was the source of lift to spark several showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening. Some thunderstorms became severe, producing a funnel cloud and two tornadoes.","A tornado affected the downtown Fort Lauderdale area on the evening of January 6th. First visible signs of damage were along SE 12TH ST where large branches were down in front of a home. The tornado then traveled 1.5 miles northeast through portions of Rio Vista Isles, across the New River, and then across several streets just south of Sunset Lake before lifting in the vicinity of East Las Olas Blvd per video evidence. Most of the damage observed along the path was minor tree, roof, and power line damage. Therefore, the tornado is rated as an EF-0 with estimated maximum winds near 80 mph, however, most of the damage was likely in the 60-70 mph range. Damage amounts are estimated.","CSV"

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap actually featured some of the most extreme conditions endured in three to four decades! The entire 24-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info). ||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following statistics are from ASOS observations at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island (GRI), where conditions were reasonably representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 1.1 F (average daily high temperature 9.5 /average daily low -7.4). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -4.7). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.6 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 12-36 F below normal. Six of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 10 F (as cold as -3 on the 14th), and seven of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -17 on the 14th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Turning to hourly temperature data from the Grand Island ASOS, it registered TEMPERATURES AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR AN INCREDIBLE 90-STRAIGHT HOURS between the evening of the 12th and the late morning of the 16th...the longest streak in 40 winters (since a 202-hour run in Dec. 1983)! Looking beyond Grand Island to other South Central Nebraska NWS Cooperative Observer sites and airport sensors, some of the very coldest readings reported during this stretch were -21 at Red Cloud and Greeley, and -20 in/near Central City, York and Genoa. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of the 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when dozens of automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -45 F.  A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by ASOS/AWOS/Nebraska Mesonet stations included -46 at Ord airport, -43 at Aurora airport, -42 near Gothenburg and -41 at Hastings airport along with near Alda and Central City. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -10 and -20 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However. on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, at the Grand Island ASOS (GRI), meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 3.6 F ABOVE normal...marking the 7th-warmest winter on record out of 129. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three-month season would have averaged around 2.6 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across South Central Nebraska in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 7-16 inches between the 8th-18th (highest along/east of Highway 281), with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Osceola accumulated 18.5 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in over 50 years...since Dec. 1973! Please refer to separate episode/event narratives for more specific details regarding Jan. 2024 snow events.

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap at least rivaled some of the more extreme conditions endured in over 30 years! The entire six-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info).||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following daily statistics are from the NWS Cooperative observer in Smith Center, where conditions were reasonably representative of North Central Kansas as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 2.4 F (average daily high temperature 11.7 /average daily low -7.0). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -0.3). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.8 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 14-35 F below normal. Seven of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 15 F (as cold as -3 on the 13th), and nine of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -15 on the 16th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Looking beyond Smith Center to other local NWS Cooperative Observer sites, some of the coldest readings reported during this stretch were -17 near Burr Oak, -14 at Lovewell Dam and Kirwin Dam, and -13 at Webster Dam. Turning to hourly temperature data and calling upon ASOS observations from the Concordia airport (CNK) located just outside of this North Central Kansas area (but still reasonably representative of it), the TEMPERATURE WAS AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR A NOTABLE 52-STRAIGHT HOURS between the mornings of the 13th-15th...falling slightly short of a 58-hour run during Feb. 2021. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of this 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when several automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -35 F. A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by airport AWOS and Kansas Mesonet stations included -35 at Smith Center airport and also near Jewell, -33 at Phillipsburg airport, -31 near Stockton and -30 at Osborne. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -5 and -10 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However, on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Concordia ASOS, it's worth noting that there were 45-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WIND CHILLS -15-OR-COLDER...marking the longest stretch in 33 winters (since 51-straight hours in Dec. 1990)!||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, per the Cooperative Observer data at Smith Center, meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 2.9 F ABOVE normal...marking the 15th-warmest winter on record out of 85. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three month season would have averaged 2.7 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-66 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 6 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across North Central Kansas in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 6-12 inches between the 8th-18th, with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Lebanon accumulated 14.8 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in 14 winters...since Dec. 2009.

Snow started to develop and move across the area during the late morning and early afternoon hours of January 11th. The snow gradually ended from west to east beginning the morning of January 12th and continued into the afternoon hours. ||An upper trough over Canada and Montana plunged southward and moved over the Central Plains by the morning of January 13th. This trough brought a reinforcing shot of colder air along with stronger northerly winds gusting to 30 to 40 mph which continued on through the day on the 13th. Additional lift from this upper trough resulted in light snow during the night of January 12th and into the morning of January 13th. This resulted in additional blowing and drifting snow, and hazardous travel due to near-blizzard conditions.||This heavy snow event resulted in widespread road closures and school/activity cancellations, and even several business closures. The heaviest snow affected areas mainly along/east of Highway 281 and along/north of Highway 6, where totals reached 6-12 inches in spots. Amounts tapered off to closer to an inch for areas further west and south.

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap actually featured some of the most extreme conditions endured in three to four decades! The entire 24-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info). ||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following statistics are from ASOS observations at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island (GRI), where conditions were reasonably representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 1.1 F (average daily high temperature 9.5 /average daily low -7.4). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -4.7). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.6 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 12-36 F below normal. Six of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 10 F (as cold as -3 on the 14th), and seven of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -17 on the 14th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Turning to hourly temperature data from the Grand Island ASOS, it registered TEMPERATURES AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR AN INCREDIBLE 90-STRAIGHT HOURS between the evening of the 12th and the late morning of the 16th...the longest streak in 40 winters (since a 202-hour run in Dec. 1983)! Looking beyond Grand Island to other South Central Nebraska NWS Cooperative Observer sites and airport sensors, some of the very coldest readings reported during this stretch were -21 at Red Cloud and Greeley, and -20 in/near Central City, York and Genoa. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of the 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when dozens of automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -45 F.  A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by ASOS/AWOS/Nebraska Mesonet stations included -46 at Ord airport, -43 at Aurora airport, -42 near Gothenburg and -41 at Hastings airport along with near Alda and Central City. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -10 and -20 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However. on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, at the Grand Island ASOS (GRI), meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 3.6 F ABOVE normal...marking the 7th-warmest winter on record out of 129. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three-month season would have averaged around 2.6 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal.

The entire 24-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info). ||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following statistics are from ASOS observations at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island (GRI), where conditions were reasonably representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 1.1 F (average daily high temperature 9.5 /average daily low -7.4). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -4.7). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.6 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 12-36 F below normal. Six of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 10 F (as cold as -3 on the 14th), and seven of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -17 on the 14th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Turning to hourly temperature data from the Grand Island ASOS, it registered TEMPERATURES AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR AN INCREDIBLE 90-STRAIGHT HOURS between the evening of the 12th and the late morning of the 16th...the longest streak in 40 winters (since a 202-hour run in Dec. 1983)! Looking beyond Grand Island to other South Central Nebraska NWS Cooperative Observer sites and airport sensors, some of the very coldest readings reported during this stretch were -21 at Red Cloud and Greeley, and -20 in/near Central City, York and Genoa. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of the 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when dozens of automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -45 F.  A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by ASOS/AWOS/Nebraska Mesonet stations included -46 at Ord airport, -43 at Aurora airport, -42 near Gothenburg and -41 at Hastings airport along with near Alda and Central City. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -10 and -20 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However. on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, at the Grand Island ASOS (GRI), meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 3.6 F ABOVE normal...marking the 7th-warmest winter on record out of 129. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three-month season would have averaged around 2.6 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across South Central Nebraska in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 7-16 inches between the 8th-18th (highest along/east of Highway 281), with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Osceola accumulated 18.5 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in over 50 years...since Dec. 1973!

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap at least rivaled some of the more extreme conditions endured in over 30 years! The entire six-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info).||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following daily statistics are from the NWS Cooperative observer in Smith Center, where conditions were reasonably representative of North Central Kansas as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 2.4 F (average daily high temperature 11.7 /average daily low -7.0). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -0.3). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.8 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 14-35 F below normal. Seven of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 15 F (as cold as -3 on the 13th), and nine of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -15 on the 16th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Looking beyond Smith Center to other local NWS Cooperative Observer sites, some of the coldest readings reported during this stretch were -17 near Burr Oak, -14 at Lovewell Dam and Kirwin Dam, and -13 at Webster Dam. Turning to hourly temperature data and calling upon ASOS observations from the Concordia airport (CNK) located just outside of this North Central Kansas area (but still reasonably representative of it), the TEMPERATURE WAS AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR A NOTABLE 52-STRAIGHT HOURS between the mornings of the 13th-15th...falling slightly short of a 58-hour run during Feb. 2021. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of this 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when several automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -35 F. A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by airport AWOS and Kansas Mesonet stations included -35 at Smith Center airport and also near Jewell, -33 at Phillipsburg airport, -31 near Stockton and -30 at Osborne. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -5 and -10 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However, on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Concordia ASOS, it's worth noting that there were 45-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WIND CHILLS -15-OR-COLDER...marking the longest stretch in 33 winters (since 51-straight hours in Dec. 1990)!||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, per the Cooperative Observer data at Smith Center, meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 2.9 F ABOVE normal...marking the 15th-warmest winter on record out of 85. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three month season would have averaged 2.7 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-66 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 6 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across North Central Kansas in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 6-12 inches between the 8th-18th, with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Lebanon accumulated 14.8 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in 14 winters...since Dec. 2009.

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap actually featured some of the most extreme conditions endured in three to four decades! The entire 24-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info). ||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following statistics are from ASOS observations at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island (GRI), where conditions were reasonably representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 1.1 F (average daily high temperature 9.5 /average daily low -7.4). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -4.7). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.6 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 12-36 F below normal. Six of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 10 F (as cold as -3 on the 14th), and seven of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -17 on the 14th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Turning to hourly temperature data from the Grand Island ASOS, it registered TEMPERATURES AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR AN INCREDIBLE 90-STRAIGHT HOURS between the evening of the 12th and the late morning of the 16th...the longest streak in 40 winters (since a 202-hour run in Dec. 1983)! Looking beyond Grand Island to other South Central Nebraska NWS Cooperative Observer sites and airport sensors, some of the very coldest readings reported during this stretch were -21 at Red Cloud and Greeley, and -20 in/near Central City, York and Genoa. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of the 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when dozens of automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -45 F.  A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by ASOS/AWOS/Nebraska Mesonet stations included -46 at Ord airport, -43 at Aurora airport, -42 near Gothenburg and -41 at Hastings airport along with near Alda and Central City. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -10 and -20 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However. on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, at the Grand Island ASOS (GRI), meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 3.6 F ABOVE normal...marking the 7th-warmest winter on record out of 129. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three-month season would have averaged around 2.6 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across South Central Nebraska in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 7-16 inches between the 8th-18th (highest along/east of Highway 281), with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Osceola accumulated 18.5 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in over 50 years...since Dec. 1973! Please refer to separate episode/event narratives for more specific details regarding Jan. 2024 snow events. As for the bitter cold itself though, it did carry its own impacts, including contributing to a water pipe burst at the Central Community College campus in Hastings that flooded the basement of the Phelps Building.","The Ord Airport ASOS recorded wind chills of -45 at 9:41 AM on January 13th and -40 at 6:53 AM on January 14th.

Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter. In fact, at the Grand Island ASOS (GRI), meteorological winter as a whole (Dec. 2023-Feb. 2024) actually averaged 3.6 F ABOVE normal...marking the 7th-warmest winter on record out of 129. However, because the 10-day, Jan. 11th-20th stretch was so severely frigid, it actually dragged down the seasonal average by a pronounced margin. In fact, had Jan. 11th-20th simply featured exactly normal temps, the entire three-month season would have averaged around 2.6 F warmer than it did! In the immediate aftermath of this harsh 10-day stretch, temperatures abruptly righted themselves, as each of the final 11 days of January featured near-to-well-above-normal high temperatures ranging from 31-62 F...as the 21st-31st as a whole averaged more than 7 F ABOVE normal. To be sure, the harshly cold temperatures were not the only weather story across South Central Nebraska in mid-January, as most areas also picked up cumulative snowfall of at least 7-16 inches between the 8th-18th (highest along/east of Highway 281), with at-times strong winds also promoting significant blowing/drifting snow. In fact, the NWS Cooperative Observer in Osceola accumulated 18.5 over that 11-day span, marking the snowiest 11-day period there in over 50 years...since Dec. 1973!

In terms of basic, overall average/mean temperature, the 10-day stretch from January 11th-20th marked the overall-coldest 10 days across the area in nearly three years...since the February 2021 Arctic outbreak. However, when digging deeper and examining metrics such as consecutive-hour streaks of exceeding particular temperature/wind chill thresholds, portions of this cold snap actually featured some of the most extreme conditions endured in three to four decades! The entire 24-county area was under at least a Wind Chill Advisory for the majority of these 10 days, with the overall-worst wind chills focused during a Wind Chill Warning that ran from 6 PM on the 12th through 12 PM on the 16th (see below for more specific wind chill info). ||Delving into various facts highlighting the significance of this cold stretch, and starting with actual temperatures, the following statistics are from ASOS observations at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island (GRI), where conditions were reasonably representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole. First off, the 10-day, overall-average temperature from the 11th-20th was 1.1 F (average daily high temperature 9.5 /average daily low -7.4). This was the coldest 10-day stretch since Feb. 7-16, 2021 (which averaged -4.7). Furthermore, these 10 days averaged an incredible 24.6 F below normal, with daily departures ranging anywhere from 12-36 F below normal. Six of the 10 days featured high temperatures under 10 F (as cold as -3 on the 14th), and seven of the 10 days registered sub-zero lows (as cold as -17 on the 14th). The overall-coldest days were the 12th-15th and the 19th-20th, as the 17th-18th actually snuck in a brief warm-up with high temperatures into the 20s across most of the area (albeit still several degrees below normal). Turning to hourly temperature data from the Grand Island ASOS, it registered TEMPERATURES AT-OR-BELOW ZERO FOR AN INCREDIBLE 90-STRAIGHT HOURS between the evening of the 12th and the late morning of the 16th...the longest streak in 40 winters (since a 202-hour run in Dec. 1983)! Looking beyond Grand Island to other South Central Nebraska NWS Cooperative Observer sites and airport sensors, some of the very coldest readings reported during this stretch were -21 at Red Cloud and Greeley, and -20 in/near Central City, York and Genoa. As for wind chill values, the most brutal conditions of the 10-day period occurred on the 13th-14th, when dozens of automated stations spent multiple hours at least -25 to -45 F.  A few of the most extreme wind chills measured by ASOS/AWOS/Nebraska Mesonet stations included -46 at Ord airport, -43 at Aurora airport, -42 near Gothenburg and -41 at Hastings airport along with near Alda and Central City. On the morning of the 14th, these unrelenting wind chills were mainly driven by very cold temperatures between -10 and -20 degrees in the presence of modest winds mainly under 15 MPH. However. on the 13th stronger winds were a bigger factor in the outdoor misery, with sustained speeds commonly 20-30 MPH/gusts up to around 40 MPH. Looking at hourly wind chill data from the Grand Island ASOS, not only were there 47-straight hours of Advisory-criteria wind chills at -20 F or colder (longest streak in 33 winters...since 58 hours in Dec. 1990), but there were also 31-CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF WARNING-CRITERIA WIND CHILLS OF -30-OR-COLDER (longest stretch in 34 winters...since 37 hours in Dec. 1989)! ||Despite its significance, this 10-day run of extreme cold actually ended up being a notable anomaly in an otherwise very mild meteorological winter.

Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County.

This system brought moderate to heavy precipitation to the Sierra Nevada which picked up between 2 and 4 inches of liquid precipitation north of Kings Canyon and 1 to 2 inches further south. The precipitation fell as snow above 5000 feet for the duration of the event and produced 2 to 4 feet on new snowfall north of Kings Canyon and 1.5 to 3 feet of snow further south. This system also produced a half inch to an inch of rainfall in Merced County and a quarter to half inch across most of the remainder of the San Joaquin Valley. Most of the Kern County Mountains and Deserts picked up 1 to 2 tenths of an inch of rainfall. In addition to the precipitation, strong winds also accompanied this system and combined with the snow to produce near blizzard conditions over the Sierra Nevada north of Kings Canyon between the morning of March 1 and the morning of March 3. Scattered thunderstorms also broke out during the afternoons of March 1 and March 2 over parts of the San Joaquin Valley. While the thunderstorms were not heavy rain producers, several funnel clouds were observed and one cell produced a weak tornado in northeast Madera during the afternoon of March 1.

The precipitation fell as snow above 5000 feet for the duration of the event and produced 2 to 4 feet on new snowfall north of Kings Canyon and 1.5 to 3 feet of snow further south. This system also produced a half inch to an inch of rainfall in Merced County and a quarter to half inch across most of the remainder of the San Joaquin Valley. Most of the Kern County Mountains and Deserts picked up 1 to 2 tenths of an inch of rainfall. In addition to the precipitation, strong winds also accompanied this system and combined with the snow to produce near blizzard conditions over the Sierra Nevada north of Kings Canyon between the morning of March 1 and the morning of March 3. Scattered thunderstorms also broke out during the afternoons of March 1 and March 2 over parts of the San Joaquin Valley. While the thunderstorms were not heavy rain producers, several funnel clouds were observed and one cell produced a weak tornado in northeast Madera during the afternoon of March 1.

The trough then slowly moved east across the Pacific Northwest on March 2 and 3 before moving east of the region on March 4. This system brought moderate to heavy precipitation to the Sierra Nevada which picked up between 2 and 4 inches of liquid precipitation north of Kings Canyon and 1 to 2 inches further south. The precipitation fell as snow above 5000 feet for the duration of the event and produced 2 to 4 feet on new snowfall north of Kings Canyon and 1.5 to 3 feet of snow further south. This system also produced a half inch to an inch of rainfall in Merced County and a quarter to half inch across most of the remainder of the San Joaquin Valley. Most of the Kern County Mountains and Deserts picked up 1 to 2 tenths of an inch of rainfall. In addition to the precipitation, strong winds also accompanied this system and combined with the snow to produce near blizzard conditions over the Sierra Nevada north of Kings Canyon between the morning of March 1 and the morning of March 3. Scattered thunderstorms also broke out during the afternoons of March 1 and March 2 over parts of the San Joaquin Valley. While the thunderstorms were not heavy rain producers, several funnel clouds were observed and one cell produced a weak tornado in northeast Madera during the afternoon of March 1. In addition to the precipitation, several stations in the Kern County Mountains and Deserts measured wind gusts exceeding 45 mph between the evening of March 2 and the early morning of March 4.","The Kaiser Point SNOTEL (9131 feet) picked up an estimated 18 inches of new snowfall.","CSV"

Embedded in this pattern, a compact shortwave trough was analyzed over northeast Montana and southern Saskatchewan. At the surface, a low pressure system was deepening in the Wyoming-Colorado-Nebraska tri-state area. North of this developing surface low, a cold front extended along the Montana-Wyoming state line and northeast across North Dakota. During the day on the 18th, the aforementioned shortwave trough dove southward across the Plains. The surface cold front followed suit, moving south-southeast across the northern and central Great Plains while the surface low tracked south-southeast through the High Plains. ||Ahead of this cold front and shortwave trough, strong forcing for ascent allowed for a shield of moderate to heavy snow to develop across northern Nebraska and South Dakota by 8 am. This area of snow moved into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa by 11 am that morning with the surface cold front lagging just behind the bulk of the precipitation. Snow continued to fill in across the region through the early afternoon hours with visibilities under a mile at times and gusty winds up to 30 miles per hour. After 3 pm, the surface cold front accelerated and undercut the back side of the snow falling across the region. This produced snow squall conditions across the central third of the CWA. For locations impacted by the snow squall, conditions rapidly deteriorated with near zero visibilities and winds gusting up to 50 miles per hour. These conditions lasted anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes before snow came to an end behind the snow squall. Several crashes were reported as a result of the snow squall, most of which was in Platte County. The largest crash of the event happened in this county on Highway 91 just outside of Humphrey where around 25 cars were involved in a pileup. One injury was reported and dozens of people were taken to local shelters. The National Weather Service in Valley issued the first two snow squall warnings in office history. The second of these warnings included the Lincoln and Omaha metropolitan areas, drawing media attention that lasted for days after the event.||Significant travel impacts did not end behind the snow squall. Continued gusty winds up to 45 miles per hour brought significant blowing and drifting snow through the evening hours across much of east-central Nebraska and western Iowa. This resulted in widespread road closures as snow drifts made travel extremely hazardous if not impossible.

Continued gusty winds up to 45 miles per hour brought significant blowing and drifting snow through the evening hours across much of east-central Nebraska and western Iowa. This resulted in widespread road closures as snow drifts made travel extremely hazardous if not impossible. Many roads remained closed through the overnight hours and into the day on the 19th.","Just before noon on the 18th, snow began to fall across the county. Freezing fog and periods of heavy snow resulted in visibilities under a mile through 5:15 pm. At this time a cold front moved through the county bringing wind gusts up to 40 miles per hour and visibilities ranging from 2 to 5 miles through the evening hours due to significant blowing and drifting snow. These conditions resulted in widespread road closures across the county by the night of the 18th.||An estimated 2 to 4 inches of snow fell across the county during this event. This included a snowfall report of 4 inches out of Craig. This winter storm warning was verified based on the extremely dangerous travel impacts associated with this event.","CSV"

Embedded in this pattern, a compact shortwave trough was analyzed over northeast Montana and southern Saskatchewan. At the surface, a low pressure system was deepening in the Wyoming-Colorado-Nebraska tri-state area. North of this developing surface low, a cold front extended along the Montana-Wyoming state line and northeast across North Dakota. During the day on the 18th, the aforementioned shortwave trough dove southward across the Plains. The surface cold front followed suit, moving south-southeast across the northern and central Great Plains while the surface low tracked south-southeast through the High Plains. ||Ahead of this cold front and shortwave trough, strong forcing for ascent allowed for a shield of moderate to heavy snow to develop across northern Nebraska and South Dakota by 8 am. This area of snow moved into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa by 11 am that morning with the surface cold front lagging just behind the bulk of the precipitation. Snow continued to fill in across the region through the early afternoon hours with visibilities under a mile at times and gusty winds up to 30 miles per hour. After 3 pm, the surface cold front accelerated and undercut the back side of the snow falling across the region. This produced snow squall conditions across the central third of the CWA. For locations impacted by the snow squall, conditions rapidly deteriorated with near zero visibilities and winds gusting up to 50 miles per hour. These conditions lasted anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes before snow came to an end behind the snow squall. Several crashes were reported as a result of the snow squall, most of which was in Platte County. The largest crash of the event happened in this county on Highway 91 just outside of Humphrey where around 25 cars were involved in a pileup. One injury was reported and dozens of people were taken to local shelters. The National Weather Service in Valley issued the first two snow squall warnings in office history. The second of these warnings included the Lincoln and Omaha metropolitan areas, drawing media attention that lasted for days after the event.||Significant travel impacts did not end behind the snow squall.

Falling snow in addition to blowing snow brought visibilities under 2 miles through the afternoon hours. Between 3:30 pm and 5 pm, a snow squall moved through the county. The snow squall brought 30 to 40 minutes of up to 35 miles per hour wind gusts and visibilities down to half a mile. Behind the snow squall, wind gusts up to 45 miles per hour continued through 11 pm. Blowing and drifting snow caused by these strong winds closed roads across the entire county by the night of the 18th.||An estimated 1 to 4 inches of snow fell across the county during this event, with higher amounts to the east. This included snowfall reports of 2.5 and 3.5 inches out of Fremont. Winter storm conditions were verified for this event due to significant and dangerous impacts on travel.","CSV"
