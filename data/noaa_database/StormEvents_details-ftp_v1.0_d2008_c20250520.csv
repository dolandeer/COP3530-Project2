Low pressure developed along the frontal boundary across the southeastern states late on the night of the 10th into the 11th.  The low then tracked rapidly to the northeast, spreading a significant amount of precipitation into New England. A deep layer of warm air aloft and sub-freezing air at the surface resulted in a major ice storm across interior Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire as well as much of northern New England. ||The hardest hit areas in southern New England were the Monadnock region of southwest New Hampshire, the Worcester Hills in central Massachusetts, and the east slopes of the Berkshires in western Massachusetts. Anywhere from half an inch to an inch of ice accreted on many exposed surfaces. Especially when combined with breezy conditions, the ice downed numerous trees, branches, and power lines which resulted in widespread power outages. More than 300,000 customers were reportedly without power in Massachusetts and an additional 300,000 were without power in the state of New Hampshire. Because of the breadth of this storm (from Pennsylvania to Maine), extra crews to reinstate power were harder to come by.  Power crews from states as far away as South Carolina, as well as local National Guard teams, were called out to help with power restoration and clean up.  While most people had their power restored within a week, others were still without power at Christmas (nearly 2 weeks later). During this period, temperatures were mostly below normal and at least one major snowstorm affected the same area.  At the time of the December 19th snowstorm, over 100,000 customers were still without power in the two states combined.  Most communities had opened shelters to provide a warm, safe place for residents.  According to the numbers reported in local newspapers, most did not take advantage of this opportunity and chose to remain in their homes, using wood stoves or generators for heat.  Many schools, a week and a half from the winter holiday break at the time of the storm, cancelled school for the remainder of the month because of a lack of electricity and clear routes for transporting students.  ||A public works employee, supervising storm clean up in Marlborough, went missing during his shift and was found dead two days later in a reservoir.  Because this occurred as a part of his job, following the storm, it was considered an indirect fatality.  Damage to the infrastructure in Massachusetts and New Hampshire amounted to roughly eighty million dollars.  This amount does not include damage to private property, which was unavailable at the time of this report.  The extent of the damage and number of people affected prompted the governors of both Massachusetts and New Hampshire to request federal assistance.  FEMA approved both requests.  President Bush issued a Major Disaster Declaration for Public Assistance for seven Massachusetts counties and all of New Hampshire.","Half an inch of ice accumulated on exposed surfaces across eastern Hillsborough County.

At the Buffalo Airport, wind gusts blew several jetways into the terminal building and the airport lost power during much of the storm. In Ripley, downed powerlines caused the closing of the eastbound lanes of the New York State Thruway. At Orchard Park, the wind tore a 2 feet by 50 feet section of the roof the Buffalo Bills field house. The wind picked up gravel and windows and windshields of numerous cars in the stadium parking lot were broken. Inside the stadium, the strong winds tilted both goal posts.

Temperatures Friday afternoon soared to records levels in the upper 60s.  In fact, daily high temperature records were set in Kansas City, St. Joseph, Concordia, Joplin, Springfield, Vichy-Rolla, and Des Moines.  This spring-like air mass set the stage for a rapid swing in weather conditions across the area, with extensive snow melt in Iowa creating ice jams and river flooding.||By the evening hours of the 26th, the powerful upper level storm system was beginning to bear down on the Central Plains.  A potent cold front was swinging through Nebraska and Iowa, with the development of thunderstorm activity across much of eastern Kansas and west central Missouri by 9 pm.  This thunderstorm activity, while strong to severe, caused litte in the way of damage, however did produce flash flooding in areas from Warrensburg, MO to Moberly, MO.||After midnight however, a large line of thunderstorms began to develop further to the west along the aforementioned cold front stretching from central Kansas into northwestern Missouri.  Additional stronger thunderstorms developed in areas near Emporia, KS and further southward along Interstate 35 by 3 am.  These thunderstorms would go on to produce widespread wind damage as they lifted northward into the Kansas City Metro and areas to the south and east.

This band remained intense as it drifted north up the lake into the Buffalo South Towns by dark, then lifted quickly across the Buffalo metro area during the evening and then stalled in a weakened form up over Niagara county and Niagara Peninsula before dissipating Saturday morning.

Winds turned southwest and increased to 30 to 40 mph with higher gusts by early afternoon over the west and almost as strong by late Sunday afternoon east of Lake Ontario. The strong winds inhibited single band formation, but resulted in a broad 20-30 mile wide area of lake snows northeast of Lake Erie right across the Buffalo metro area during the afternoon, which gradually settled south across the city and nearby southern suburbs in the evening. The winds created whiteouts and near blizzard conditions at times, with drifts commonly three feet across the entire Buffalo metro area.

The main activity was over Jefferson and northern Lewis counties Sunday afternoon and night, gradually shifting south across Oswego county Monday and settling across the Syracuse area later Monday before shifting north and weakening Tuesday morning.  Snowfall amounts were close to a foot across metro Buffalo with a bit more in a strip from Hamburg to West Seneca to Elma to Batavia. Six inches fell up into far southern Niagara County, and even Rochester caught three inches as the band extended that far east for a time Sunday evening. Off Ontario the heaviest amounts fell from central Jefferson to northern Lewis counties, although a narrow area of a foot also was recorded in the Syracuse area and far southern Oswego County as the band stalled Monday.  The strong winds and frigid temperatures combined with the heavy snow to create the worst whiteout conditions and drifting in the Buffalo area in several years.

Six inches fell up into far southern Niagara County, and even Rochester caught three inches as the band extended that far east for a time Sunday evening. Off Ontario the heaviest amounts fell from central Jefferson to northern Lewis counties, although a narrow area of a foot also was recorded in the Syracuse area and far southern Oswego County as the band stalled Monday.  The strong winds and frigid temperatures combined with the heavy snow to create the worst whiteout conditions and drifting in the Buffalo area in several years. Activities were ground to a halt with several major highways closed, including the I-90 NYS Thruway. Numerous automobile accidents were reported, including a fatal crash in Cambria.","","CSV"

At the Buffalo Airport, wind gusts blew several jetways into the terminal building and the airport lost power during much of the storm. In Ripley, downed powerlines caused the closing of the eastbound lanes of the New York State Thruway. At Orchard Park, the wind tore a 2 feet by 50 feet section of the roof the Buffalo Bills field house. The wind picked up gravel and windows and windshields of numerous cars in the stadium parking lot were broken. Inside the stadium, the strong winds tilted both goal posts.

Winds accompanying the system increased rapidly across the area ranging from 30 to 40 m.p.h. sustained readings with the strongest gusts downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario. A peak gust of 75 m.p.h. was recorded at 8:21 a.m. EST at the Buffalo Airport. Close to 100,000 customers lost power during the storm and nearly 90,000 were without phone service. Downed trees damaged several structures and automobiles. The strong winds tore off roofs and shingles on many buildings. At the Buffalo Airport, wind gusts blew several jetways into the terminal building and the airport lost power during much of the storm. In Ripley, downed powerlines caused the closing of the eastbound lanes of the New York State Thruway. At Orchard Park, the wind tore a 2 feet by 50 feet section of the roof the Buffalo Bills field house. The wind picked up gravel and windows and windshields of numerous cars in the stadium parking lot were broken. Inside the stadium, the strong winds tilted both goal posts. Also near the stadium, a concession trailer was blown over with only minor injuries to the occupants reported. The Thousand Islands Bridge was closed for five hours after wind gusts flipped two southbound trucks.","","CSV"

In fact, daily high temperature records were set in Kansas City, St. Joseph, Concordia, Joplin, Springfield, Vichy-Rolla, and Des Moines.  This spring-like air mass set the stage for a rapid swing in weather conditions across the area, with extensive snow melt in Iowa creating ice jams and river flooding.||By the evening hours of the 26th, the powerful upper level storm system was beginning to bear down on the Central Plains.  A potent cold front was swinging through Nebraska and Iowa, with the development of thunderstorm activity across much of eastern Kansas and west central Missouri by 9 pm.  This thunderstorm activity, while strong to severe, caused litte in the way of damage, however did produce flash flooding in areas from Warrensburg, MO to Moberly, MO.||After midnight however, a large line of thunderstorms began to develop further to the west along the aforementioned cold front stretching from central Kansas into northwestern Missouri.  Additional stronger thunderstorms developed in areas near Emporia, KS and further southward along Interstate 35 by 3 am.  These thunderstorms would go on to produce widespread wind damage as they lifted northward into the Kansas City Metro and areas to the south and east.

In fact, daily high temperature records were set in Kansas City, St. Joseph, Concordia, Joplin, Springfield, Vichy-Rolla, and Des Moines.  This spring-like air mass set the stage for a rapid swing in weather conditions across the area, with extensive snow melt in Iowa creating ice jams and river flooding.||By the evening hours of the 26th, the powerful upper level storm system was beginning to bear down on the Central Plains.  A potent cold front was swinging through Nebraska and Iowa, with the development of thunderstorm activity across much of eastern Kansas and west central Missouri by 9 pm.  This thunderstorm activity, while strong to severe, caused litte in the way of damage, however did produce flash flooding in areas from Warrensburg, MO to Moberly, MO.||After midnight however, a large line of thunderstorms began to develop further to the west along the aforementioned cold front stretching from central Kansas into northwestern Missouri.  Additional stronger thunderstorms developed in areas near Emporia, KS and further southward along Interstate 35 by 3 am.  These thunderstorms would go on to produce widespread wind damage as they lifted northward into the Kansas City Metro and areas to the south and east.

Temperatures Friday afternoon soared to records levels in the upper 60s.  In fact, daily high temperature records were set in Kansas City, St. Joseph, Concordia, Joplin, Springfield, Vichy-Rolla, and Des Moines.  This spring-like air mass set the stage for a rapid swing in weather conditions across the area, with extensive snow melt in Iowa creating ice jams and river flooding.||By the evening hours of the 26th, the powerful upper level storm system was beginning to bear down on the Central Plains.  A potent cold front was swinging through Nebraska and Iowa, with the development of thunderstorm activity across much of eastern Kansas and west central Missouri by 9 pm.  This thunderstorm activity, while strong to severe, caused litte in the way of damage, however did produce flash flooding in areas from Warrensburg, MO to Moberly, MO.||After midnight however, a large line of thunderstorms began to develop further to the west along the aforementioned cold front stretching from central Kansas into northwestern Missouri.  Additional stronger thunderstorms developed in areas near Emporia, KS and further southward along Interstate 35 by 3 am.  These thunderstorms would go on to produce widespread wind damage as they lifted northward into the Kansas City Metro and areas to the south and east.  Composite radar imagery below indicates the regional progression of this line of storms and their track across the region.","","CSV"

A peak gust of 75 m.p.h. was recorded at 8:21 a.m. EST at the Buffalo Airport. Close to 100,000 customers lost power during the storm and nearly 90,000 were without phone service. Downed trees damaged several structures and automobiles. The strong winds tore off roofs and shingles on many buildings. At the Buffalo Airport, wind gusts blew several jetways into the terminal building and the airport lost power during much of the storm. In Ripley, downed powerlines caused the closing of the eastbound lanes of the New York State Thruway. At Orchard Park, the wind tore a 2 feet by 50 feet section of the roof the Buffalo Bills field house. The wind picked up gravel and windows and windshields of numerous cars in the stadium parking lot were broken. Inside the stadium, the strong winds tilted both goal posts. Also near the stadium, a concession trailer was blown over with only minor injuries to the occupants reported. The Thousand Islands Bridge was closed for five hours after wind gusts flipped two southbound trucks.","","CSV"

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.","On the east side of town, more damage from the forward flank downdraft occurred. Here, numerous trees were snapped, uprooted or had large limbs broken off. One area along Highway 50 was especially hard hit. Here several storage sheds were flipped and destroyed. Debris was blown into a few buildings and caused damage to windows and the roofs. Several trees were also snapped in the area. On the north side of the highway, a large office building sustained substantial shingle damage. Like on the south side of town, all the damage was blown to the south and southeast.","CSV"

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.","A swath of pea to penny sized hail continued to fall from the long lived supercell thunderstorm which was responsible for producing the two EF3 tornadoes across Holmes, Attala, and Choctaw Counties.","CSV"

The heaviest rainfall fell over favored south-facing mountain slopes. The total amount of rainfall, combined with rainfall rates around 1 inch per hour, produced numerous reports of flooding as well as mud and debris flows. The mountains received significant snowfall, espeically at the resort levels where 12 to 24 inches of snow fell. Along with the intense precipitation, the storm brought some very strong and gusty southerly winds to the area. The strongest winds were reported across San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties as well as all mountain areas. The winds knocked down trees and power lines, producing numerous power outages.","A mud and debris flow developed around the Barham Burn area.

Winds turned southwest and increased to 30 to 40 mph with higher gusts by early afternoon over the west and almost as strong by late Sunday afternoon east of Lake Ontario. The strong winds inhibited single band formation, but resulted in a broad 20-30 mile wide area of lake snows northeast of Lake Erie right across the Buffalo metro area during the afternoon, which gradually settled south across the city and nearby southern suburbs in the evening. The winds created whiteouts and near blizzard conditions at times, with drifts commonly three feet across the entire Buffalo metro area. An upper air disturbance crossed around 3 a.m. on Monday the 22nd and bands shifted south where they remained in a weakened form across southern Erie and northern Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties during the day Monday before drifting north and weakening Monday night.  Off Lake Ontario, a similar scenario ensued, but about 4 to 6 hours later. The main activity was over Jefferson and northern Lewis counties Sunday afternoon and night, gradually shifting south across Oswego county Monday and settling across the Syracuse area later Monday before shifting north and weakening Tuesday morning.  Snowfall amounts were close to a foot across metro Buffalo with a bit more in a strip from Hamburg to West Seneca to Elma to Batavia. Six inches fell up into far southern Niagara County, and even Rochester caught three inches as the band extended that far east for a time Sunday evening. Off Ontario the heaviest amounts fell from central Jefferson to northern Lewis counties, although a narrow area of a foot also was recorded in the Syracuse area and far southern Oswego County as the band stalled Monday.  The strong winds and frigid temperatures combined with the heavy snow to create the worst whiteout conditions and drifting in the Buffalo area in several years. Activities were ground to a halt with several major highways closed, including the I-90 NYS Thruway. Numerous automobile accidents were reported, including a fatal crash in Cambria.","","CSV"

The winds created whiteouts and near blizzard conditions at times, with drifts commonly three feet across the entire Buffalo metro area. An upper air disturbance crossed around 3 a.m. on Monday the 22nd and bands shifted south where they remained in a weakened form across southern Erie and northern Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties during the day Monday before drifting north and weakening Monday night.  Off Lake Ontario, a similar scenario ensued, but about 4 to 6 hours later. The main activity was over Jefferson and northern Lewis counties Sunday afternoon and night, gradually shifting south across Oswego county Monday and settling across the Syracuse area later Monday before shifting north and weakening Tuesday morning.  Snowfall amounts were close to a foot across metro Buffalo with a bit more in a strip from Hamburg to West Seneca to Elma to Batavia. Six inches fell up into far southern Niagara County, and even Rochester caught three inches as the band extended that far east for a time Sunday evening. Off Ontario the heaviest amounts fell from central Jefferson to northern Lewis counties, although a narrow area of a foot also was recorded in the Syracuse area and far southern Oswego County as the band stalled Monday.  The strong winds and frigid temperatures combined with the heavy snow to create the worst whiteout conditions and drifting in the Buffalo area in several years. Activities were ground to a halt with several major highways closed, including the I-90 NYS Thruway. Numerous automobile accidents were reported, including a fatal crash in Cambria.","","CSV"

The winds created whiteouts and near blizzard conditions at times, with drifts commonly three feet across the entire Buffalo metro area. An upper air disturbance crossed around 3 a.m. on Monday the 22nd and bands shifted south where they remained in a weakened form across southern Erie and northern Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties during the day Monday before drifting north and weakening Monday night.  Off Lake Ontario, a similar scenario ensued, but about 4 to 6 hours later. The main activity was over Jefferson and northern Lewis counties Sunday afternoon and night, gradually shifting south across Oswego county Monday and settling across the Syracuse area later Monday before shifting north and weakening Tuesday morning.  Snowfall amounts were close to a foot across metro Buffalo with a bit more in a strip from Hamburg to West Seneca to Elma to Batavia. Six inches fell up into far southern Niagara County, and even Rochester caught three inches as the band extended that far east for a time Sunday evening. Off Ontario the heaviest amounts fell from central Jefferson to northern Lewis counties, although a narrow area of a foot also was recorded in the Syracuse area and far southern Oswego County as the band stalled Monday.  The strong winds and frigid temperatures combined with the heavy snow to create the worst whiteout conditions and drifting in the Buffalo area in several years. Activities were ground to a halt with several major highways closed, including the I-90 NYS Thruway. Numerous automobile accidents were reported, including a fatal crash in Cambria.","","CSV"

The airmass became unstable by afternoon with CAPE values in the 2000 to 3000 J/kg range, and lifted indices between -4 and -7 C.  The atmosphere became more sheared as the afternoon progressed, with 30 to 45 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  Available downdraft CAPE was 700 to 900 J/kg, with cape available in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere between 300 and 400 J/kg.  Initially, a scattered line of thunderstorms formed over eastern parts of Nebraska and South Dakota.  The line became more solidified as it moved into Iowa.  A few rogue cells developed ahead of the line, and became severe.  One of them produced baseball size hail southwest of Earlham in Madison County.  For the most part, the storms produced hail in the three quarter to one inch diameter size.  The storms produced gusty winds in most areas.  There were several reports of winds around 60 MPH or so with the stronger storms.  Most of the wind damage was limited to trees and power lines.  A beta bow element moved through Cass County, destroying a machine shed there as high winds tore it apart.","","CSV"

A warm front was positioned to the south of Iowa.  Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.  Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.  The entire length of the line produced 40 to 50 MPH winds however.  Hail was somewhat limited as the freezing level was over 14,000 feet.  Following the passage of the line, high winds became a problem as a wake low developed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Story County at Colo and wind damage was reported in Polk County at Bondurant.","Winds were estimated at 60 MPH.","CSV"

The system was very fast moving with a strong jet of 165 kts streaming up the east side of the trough.  A short wave ejected out of the trough and raced northeast through the central U.S., reaching Illinois by the morning of the 19th.  Low pressure at the surface formed over western Kansas during the afternoon of the 18th. It moved to northeast Kansas by evening, and to near Burlington, IA by sunrise on the 19th.  A strong low level jet pushed moisture over a polar airmass that was in place over Iowa.  In addition, the atmosphere became quite unstable for December over the state, resulting in the development of thunderstorms over a large part of Iowa during the overnight hours of the 18th into the 19th.  Temperatures over southern Iowa remained in the 20s through the event, though the cold layer was quite shallow.  Temperatures aloft rose well above freezing, thus most of the precipitation that fell came in the form of freezing rain.  The freezing rain turned to sleet and snow briefly before ending.  Heavy ice accumulations occurred over southern Iowa, especially the southwest and southeast parts of the DSM CWA.  Ice accrual reached one half inch over Davis County, and around 0.6 inches in Adams Counties for the heaviest amounts.  Most of the area received between 0.25 and 0.4 inches of ice.  Spotty power outages were reported, however much of the power problems were mitigated by efforts the previous summer with tree trimming by the power utilities. Roads became very icy with all roads 100% ice covered.  Nearly all schools and many activities were cancelled for the 19th due to the ice.","","CSV"

A warm front was positioned to the south of Iowa.  Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.  Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.  The entire length of the line produced 40 to 50 MPH winds however.  Hail was somewhat limited as the freezing level was over 14,000 feet.  Following the passage of the line, high winds became a problem as a wake low developed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Story County at Colo and wind damage was reported in Polk County at Bondurant.","","CSV"

A warm front was positioned to the south of Iowa.  Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.  Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.  The entire length of the line produced 40 to 50 MPH winds however.  Hail was somewhat limited as the freezing level was over 14,000 feet.  Following the passage of the line, high winds became a problem as a wake low developed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Story County at Colo and wind damage was reported in Polk County at Bondurant.","","CSV"

A strong low level jet pushed moisture over a polar airmass that was in place over Iowa.  In addition, the atmosphere became quite unstable for December over the state, resulting in the development of thunderstorms over a large part of Iowa during the overnight hours of the 18th into the 19th.  Temperatures over southern Iowa remained in the 20s through the event, though the cold layer was quite shallow.  Temperatures aloft rose well above freezing, thus most of the precipitation that fell came in the form of freezing rain.  The freezing rain turned to sleet and snow briefly before ending.  Heavy ice accumulations occurred over southern Iowa, especially the southwest and southeast parts of the DSM CWA.  Ice accrual reached one half inch over Davis County, and around 0.6 inches in Adams Counties for the heaviest amounts.  Most of the area received between 0.25 and 0.4 inches of ice.

A band of heavy snow set up along this convergence line, fed at its western end by Lake Erie. This band dropped just to the south of Chautauqua County during the evening, after 6 to 8 inch totals. Winds turned north-northeasterly and another band set up from Dunkirk to Ripley which became heavy overnight and early Friday morning as winds backed to north-northwest. Six to twelve inches fell during this phase along the lakeshore. The flow turned strong northwest later Friday and remained so through Saturday. This flow was unusually cold for November but very dry, so multiple bands formed off Lake Ontario and continued for 36 to 48 hours.

A short wave ejected out of the trough and raced northeast through the central U.S., reaching Illinois by the morning of the 19th.  Low pressure at the surface formed over western Kansas during the afternoon of the 18th. It moved to northeast Kansas by evening, and to near Burlington, IA by sunrise on the 19th.  A strong low level jet pushed moisture over a polar airmass that was in place over Iowa.  In addition, the atmosphere became quite unstable for December over the state, resulting in the development of thunderstorms over a large part of Iowa during the overnight hours of the 18th into the 19th.  Temperatures over southern Iowa remained in the 20s through the event, though the cold layer was quite shallow.  Temperatures aloft rose well above freezing, thus most of the precipitation that fell came in the form of freezing rain.  The freezing rain turned to sleet and snow briefly before ending.  Heavy ice accumulations occurred over southern Iowa, especially the southwest and southeast parts of the DSM CWA.  Ice accrual reached one half inch over Davis County, and around 0.6 inches in Adams Counties for the heaviest amounts.  Most of the area received between 0.25 and 0.4 inches of ice.  Spotty power outages were reported, however much of the power problems were mitigated by efforts the previous summer with tree trimming by the power utilities. Roads became very icy with all roads 100% ice covered.  Nearly all schools and many activities were cancelled for the 19th due to the ice.","","CSV"

At the same time, a strong low pressure deepened in the upper atmosphere over and just northeast of the state.  The combination drew down Arctic air into the central U.S. A tight pressure gradient developed between the developing low to the east and Arctic high pressure to the northwest.  Winds increased on the 20th, and continued through most of the day on the 21st.  Sustained wind speeds were in the 25 to 35 MPH range, with gusts of 40 to 50 MPH.  Very little snow fell with the inverted trough, generally an inch or two, however antecedent snow cover was quite high with 7 to 12 inches common.  The winds caused whiteout conditions for an extended period of time as the snow that was loose blew in open areas.  Much of the deeper snow had crusted over, so blizzard conditions were somewhat sporadic and not as widespread as would normally be expected.  The first and second order reporting stations did not meet blizzard criteria outside of occasionally, however law enforcement officials reported visibility frequently reduced to between 10 and 100 feet in open areas.  Travel was therefore not recommended across all of the northern part of Iowa north of U.S. Highway 30.  Roads drifted shut quickly and snowplows were taken off of several roads during the height of the storm.  In addition to the wind, temperatures fell below zero, resulting in dangerous wind chill indices in the -30 to -40 F. range.","","CSV"

The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.

Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.  The entire length of the line produced 40 to 50 MPH winds however.  Hail was somewhat limited as the freezing level was over 14,000 feet.  Following the passage of the line, high winds became a problem as a wake low developed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Story County at Colo and wind damage was reported in Polk County at Bondurant.","The Raccoon River was flooding over Highway 169.","CSV"

A short wave ejected out of the trough and raced northeast through the central U.S., reaching Illinois by the morning of the 19th.  Low pressure at the surface formed over western Kansas during the afternoon of the 18th. It moved to northeast Kansas by evening, and to near Burlington, IA by sunrise on the 19th.  A strong low level jet pushed moisture over a polar airmass that was in place over Iowa.  In addition, the atmosphere became quite unstable for December over the state, resulting in the development of thunderstorms over a large part of Iowa during the overnight hours of the 18th into the 19th.  Temperatures over southern Iowa remained in the 20s through the event, though the cold layer was quite shallow.  Temperatures aloft rose well above freezing, thus most of the precipitation that fell came in the form of freezing rain.  The freezing rain turned to sleet and snow briefly before ending.  Heavy ice accumulations occurred over southern Iowa, especially the southwest and southeast parts of the DSM CWA.  Ice accrual reached one half inch over Davis County, and around 0.6 inches in Adams Counties for the heaviest amounts.  Most of the area received between 0.25 and 0.4 inches of ice.  Spotty power outages were reported, however much of the power problems were mitigated by efforts the previous summer with tree trimming by the power utilities.

At the same time, a strong low pressure deepened in the upper atmosphere over and just northeast of the state.  The combination drew down Arctic air into the central U.S. A tight pressure gradient developed between the developing low to the east and Arctic high pressure to the northwest.  Winds increased on the 20th, and continued through most of the day on the 21st.  Sustained wind speeds were in the 25 to 35 MPH range, with gusts of 40 to 50 MPH.  Very little snow fell with the inverted trough, generally an inch or two, however antecedent snow cover was quite high with 7 to 12 inches common.  The winds caused whiteout conditions for an extended period of time as the snow that was loose blew in open areas.  Much of the deeper snow had crusted over, so blizzard conditions were somewhat sporadic and not as widespread as would normally be expected.  The first and second order reporting stations did not meet blizzard criteria outside of occasionally, however law enforcement officials reported visibility frequently reduced to between 10 and 100 feet in open areas.  Travel was therefore not recommended across all of the northern part of Iowa north of U.S. Highway 30.  Roads drifted shut quickly and snowplows were taken off of several roads during the height of the storm.  In addition to the wind, temperatures fell below zero, resulting in dangerous wind chill indices in the -30 to -40 F. range.","","CSV"

At the same time, a strong low pressure deepened in the upper atmosphere over and just northeast of the state.  The combination drew down Arctic air into the central U.S. A tight pressure gradient developed between the developing low to the east and Arctic high pressure to the northwest.  Winds increased on the 20th, and continued through most of the day on the 21st.  Sustained wind speeds were in the 25 to 35 MPH range, with gusts of 40 to 50 MPH.  Very little snow fell with the inverted trough, generally an inch or two, however antecedent snow cover was quite high with 7 to 12 inches common.  The winds caused whiteout conditions for an extended period of time as the snow that was loose blew in open areas.  Much of the deeper snow had crusted over, so blizzard conditions were somewhat sporadic and not as widespread as would normally be expected.  The first and second order reporting stations did not meet blizzard criteria outside of occasionally, however law enforcement officials reported visibility frequently reduced to between 10 and 100 feet in open areas.  Travel was therefore not recommended across all of the northern part of Iowa north of U.S. Highway 30.  Roads drifted shut quickly and snowplows were taken off of several roads during the height of the storm.  In addition to the wind, temperatures fell below zero, resulting in dangerous wind chill indices in the -30 to -40 F. range.","","CSV"

The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.

The winds caused whiteout conditions for an extended period of time as the snow that was loose blew in open areas.

A warm front was positioned to the south of Iowa.  Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.  Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.

The system was very fast moving with a strong jet of 165 kts streaming up the east side of the trough.  A short wave ejected out of the trough and raced northeast through the central U.S., reaching Illinois by the morning of the 19th.  Low pressure at the surface formed over western Kansas during the afternoon of the 18th. It moved to northeast Kansas by evening, and to near Burlington, IA by sunrise on the 19th.  A strong low level jet pushed moisture over a polar airmass that was in place over Iowa.  In addition, the atmosphere became quite unstable for December over the state, resulting in the development of thunderstorms over a large part of Iowa during the overnight hours of the 18th into the 19th.  Temperatures over southern Iowa remained in the 20s through the event, though the cold layer was quite shallow.  Temperatures aloft rose well above freezing, thus most of the precipitation that fell came in the form of freezing rain.  The freezing rain turned to sleet and snow briefly before ending.  Heavy ice accumulations occurred over southern Iowa, especially the southwest and southeast parts of the DSM CWA.  Ice accrual reached one half inch over Davis County, and around 0.6 inches in Adams Counties for the heaviest amounts.  Most of the area received between 0.25 and 0.4 inches of ice.  Spotty power outages were reported, however much of the power problems were mitigated by efforts the previous summer with tree trimming by the power utilities. Roads became very icy with all roads 100% ice covered.  Nearly all schools and many activities were cancelled for the 19th due to the ice.","","CSV"

A warm front was positioned to the south of Iowa.  Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.  Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.  The entire length of the line produced 40 to 50 MPH winds however.  Hail was somewhat limited as the freezing level was over 14,000 feet.  Following the passage of the line, high winds became a problem as a wake low developed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Story County at Colo and wind damage was reported in Polk County at Bondurant.","","CSV"

A warm front was positioned to the south of Iowa.  Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.  Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.  The entire length of the line produced 40 to 50 MPH winds however.  Hail was somewhat limited as the freezing level was over 14,000 feet.  Following the passage of the line, high winds became a problem as a wake low developed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Story County at Colo and wind damage was reported in Polk County at Bondurant.","Report received from KCCI television.","CSV"

The initial surface wind shift line had passed, however the cold front aloft lagged the wind shift by at least 150 miles. The airmass became unstable by afternoon with CAPE values in the 2000 to 3000 J/kg range, and lifted indices between -4 and -7 C.  The atmosphere became more sheared as the afternoon progressed, with 30 to 45 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  Available downdraft CAPE was 700 to 900 J/kg, with cape available in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere between 300 and 400 J/kg.  Initially, a scattered line of thunderstorms formed over eastern parts of Nebraska and South Dakota.  The line became more solidified as it moved into Iowa.  A few rogue cells developed ahead of the line, and became severe.  One of them produced baseball size hail southwest of Earlham in Madison County.

A warm front was positioned to the south of Iowa.  Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.  Appanoose County was quite hard hit with water flowing over the roads two feet deep.  The main severe mode of the system was the high winds.  There were numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds.  The entire length of the line produced 40 to 50 MPH winds however.  Hail was somewhat limited as the freezing level was over 14,000 feet.  Following the passage of the line, high winds became a problem as a wake low developed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Story County at Colo and wind damage was reported in Polk County at Bondurant.","Fifty to 60 MPH winds were reported with minor tree damage.","CSV"

The system was very fast moving with a strong jet of 165 kts streaming up the east side of the trough.  A short wave ejected out of the trough and raced northeast through the central U.S., reaching Illinois by the morning of the 19th.  Low pressure at the surface formed over western Kansas during the afternoon of the 18th. It moved to northeast Kansas by evening, and to near Burlington, IA by sunrise on the 19th.  A strong low level jet pushed moisture over a polar airmass that was in place over Iowa.  In addition, the atmosphere became quite unstable for December over the state, resulting in the development of thunderstorms over a large part of Iowa during the overnight hours of the 18th into the 19th.  Temperatures over southern Iowa remained in the 20s through the event, though the cold layer was quite shallow.  Temperatures aloft rose well above freezing, thus most of the precipitation that fell came in the form of freezing rain.  The freezing rain turned to sleet and snow briefly before ending.  Heavy ice accumulations occurred over southern Iowa, especially the southwest and southeast parts of the DSM CWA.  Ice accrual reached one half inch over Davis County, and around 0.6 inches in Adams Counties for the heaviest amounts.  Most of the area received between 0.25 and 0.4 inches of ice.  Spotty power outages were reported, however much of the power problems were mitigated by efforts the previous summer with tree trimming by the power utilities. Roads became very icy with all roads 100% ice covered.  Nearly all schools and many activities were cancelled for the 19th due to the ice.","","CSV"

At the same time, a strong low pressure deepened in the upper atmosphere over and just northeast of the state.  The combination drew down Arctic air into the central U.S. A tight pressure gradient developed between the developing low to the east and Arctic high pressure to the northwest.  Winds increased on the 20th, and continued through most of the day on the 21st.  Sustained wind speeds were in the 25 to 35 MPH range, with gusts of 40 to 50 MPH.  Very little snow fell with the inverted trough, generally an inch or two, however antecedent snow cover was quite high with 7 to 12 inches common.  The winds caused whiteout conditions for an extended period of time as the snow that was loose blew in open areas.  Much of the deeper snow had crusted over, so blizzard conditions were somewhat sporadic and not as widespread as would normally be expected.  The first and second order reporting stations did not meet blizzard criteria outside of occasionally, however law enforcement officials reported visibility frequently reduced to between 10 and 100 feet in open areas.  Travel was therefore not recommended across all of the northern part of Iowa north of U.S. Highway 30.  Roads drifted shut quickly and snowplows were taken off of several roads during the height of the storm.  In addition to the wind, temperatures fell below zero, resulting in dangerous wind chill indices in the -30 to -40 F. range.","","CSV"
