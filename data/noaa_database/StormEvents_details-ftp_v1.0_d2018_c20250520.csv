A deep southwest flow aloft was present along and behind the front across the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley, with weak embedded disturbances in the flow helping to enhance the development of scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms along and behind the front on the 21st. A warm, moist, and weakly unstable air mass had already spread north ahead of the front into Northeast Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana, with the southwest flow aloft tapping into the subtropical jet, thus transporting Pacific moisture northeast along and behind the front. Periods of moderate to at times, heavy rainfall fell along and behind the front across North Louisiana, and persisted through the early morning hours on the 23rd before diminishing. Widespread rainfall amounts of four to in excess of eight inches fell across North Louisiana from the morning hours of February 21st through the early morning hours on the 23rd. This resulted in periods of widespread flash flooding across much of North Louisiana during this 3 day period. In addition, isolated severe thunderstorms developed across the southeast sections of Northcentral Louisiana on February 21st within the warm sector along the front, which produced wind damage across Western La Salle Parish.","High water over LA 134 about 1/4 mile east of Swartz Fairbanks Road, Highway 554 in Perryville near the gravel pits, and Barnes Road.

The heaviest rains fell near and along a quasi-stationary front that lingered between northern Indiana and over the Ohio River for about a two week period. Despite dodging the heaviest rain, the area received well above normal rainfall especially over southern and eastern counties including the Muskingum and Mahoning River basins.  Though very wet, most of the area rivers were able to contain the streamflows with only minor impacts. Non-river flooding was most problematic in Knox County and portions of the upper Muskingum watershed. Numerous road closures were reported but no inundation of properties were reported.","Rainfall measured over 2.50 in Knox County produced flooding mainly south of Mt. Vernon and College Township  on the evening of the 15th. The flooding resulted in multiple road closures. Route 661 was closed south of Mt. Vernon with about a foot of water flowing across it. Rt 62 east of Mt. Vernon closed with several inches of flowing water across it. Water rescues were conducted on Lower Gambier Road after the Kokosing River overflowed its banks. The road was closed most of the day on Friday the 16th as well. Stricker Road was closed due to washed out culverts. Stull and Sapp roads, and many other were closed.","CSV"

Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  One of the tornadoes clipped far southern Houston county.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties. The highest observed rainfall total was in Walton County, where a 48-hour rainfall total of 11.45 inches was recorded. Across southeast Alabama and portions of southwest Georgia, widespread 6 to 8 inches of rain fell. While one Flash Flood Warning was issued, the majority of the impacts from this event were from moderate rainfall rates over a prolonged period of time as convection trained across the tri-state area. These high rainfall totals resulted in numerous road closures across the Florida Panhandle from water covered roads and washed out roadways. In addition, a few roads were closed across southeast Alabama.","Rosewood Road was closed due to flooding from a long duration of moderate to occasionally heavy rain.  This road intersects with a small stream that likely overflowed.","CSV"

Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  One of the tornadoes clipped far southern Houston county.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties. The highest observed rainfall total was in Walton County, where a 48-hour rainfall total of 11.45 inches was recorded. Across southeast Alabama and portions of southwest Georgia, widespread 6 to 8 inches of rain fell. While one Flash Flood Warning was issued, the majority of the impacts from this event were from moderate rainfall rates over a prolonged period of time as convection trained across the tri-state area. These high rainfall totals resulted in numerous road closures across the Florida Panhandle from water covered roads and washed out roadways. In addition, a few roads were closed across southeast Alabama.","A tornado touched down in northwest Jackson county and briefly moved into far southern Houston county. Structural damage was minimal with minor roof damage in Graceville in Jackson county. There was no reported structural damage in Houston county as the tornado tracked through a forested area.  Trees were also blown down along the track with a dual-pol tornadic debris signature observed on radar in far southern Houston county due to tree debris.  This tornado was rated EF0 with max winds estimated at 65 mph based on the observed damage.","CSV"

Meanwhile, overrunning increased during the daytime hours which led to the development of scattered showers behind the front, which developed into embedded thunderstorms as upper level disturbances shifted northeast across the area enhancing large scale lift, ahead of an upper level shortwave trough which moved into the Southern Plains during the afternoon from the Four Corners region. Steep lapse rates ahead of this shortwave trough contributed to elevated instability aloft, with deep layer shear also adequate enough for some organized post-frontal thunderstorms within a cool air mass with surface temperatures in the lower 50s. As a result, a few of these storms became severe, producing numerous reports of small and large hail across portions of Northeast Texas and Southwest Arkansas during the afternoon hours. The strong to severe thunderstorms diminished by early evening as the post-frontal rains became more widespread across the area, thus diminishing the elevated instability.","Quarter size hail fell on I-49 southeast of Texarkana.

This led to the development of isolated low topped supercells along the northward moving warm front and ahead of the eastward moving cold front. Eight tornadoes were surveyed over WFO LSX's forecast area.","A tornado touched down over the Country Classic Cars business northeast of Staunton, IL. Many videos surfaced showing a funnel develop and pass over Interstate 55. No damage could be seen west of the interstate, creating the initial damage to a carport at the business, and then cutting an approximately 50 yard path through the middle portion of the second storage shed on the property. The tornado proceeded east, depositing several pieces of sheet metal and wood onto Old Route 66 and fields to the east. Despite visible power flashed in videos, power lines looked untouched. Arching likely occurred when metal sheeting was thrown across the lines. A debris path could be seen strewn for several hundred feet to the northeast. A house, couple of farm buildings and trees were damaged on the south side of Tall Timber Road. Another structure to the north side of Tall Timber Road, at the end of Adden Road, was also damaged. Several pieces of debris could be seen in the field to the northeast of   Adden Road and to the west of Two Mile Road. However, no damage was assessed past the field, where it is likely the tornado dissipated. Additional videos from Mt. Olive show a long rope funnel ascended above the town with no damage to the community. Overall the tornado was rated EF1 with a path length of 1.39 miles and a max path width of 50 yards. No injuries or deaths were reported with this tornado.","CSV"

Meanwhile, overrunning increased during the daytime hours which led to the development of scattered showers behind the front, which developed into embedded thunderstorms as upper level disturbances shifted northeast across the area enhancing large scale lift, ahead of an upper level shortwave trough which moved into the Southern Plains during the afternoon from the Four Corners region. Steep lapse rates ahead of this shortwave trough contributed to elevated instability aloft, with deep layer shear also adequate enough for some organized post-frontal thunderstorms within a cool air mass with surface temperatures in the lower 50s. As a result, a few of these storms became severe, producing numerous reports of small and large hail across portions of Northeast Texas and Southwest Arkansas during the afternoon hours. The strong to severe thunderstorms diminished by early evening as the post-frontal rains became more widespread across the area, thus diminishing the elevated instability.","A picture was posted to the KSLA Twitter page of dime size hail that fell and covered the ground just south of Hope.","CSV"

Enough elevated instability was present to allow for isolated strong to severe thunderstorms to develop along the front during the late afternoon across Northern Sevier and Howard Counties in Southwest Arkansas, before they quickly exited the area and weakened.

While this system also pulled warmer air northward, it remained cold enough across southeastern Ohio for a period of snow during the early afternoon before changing over to rain by late afternoon. There was a narrow band that experienced a brief period of very heavy snow, with reports of 2 to 3 inches accumulating in an hour. This band was across portions of Jackson, Vinton, Athens, Meigs, and Washington Counties. Even across individual counties, snowfall accumulations varied drastically based on the location of the heaviest band. For example, in Meigs County, a member of the public measured just over 4 inches of snow near Tuppers Plains, while in Chester only 2 inches accumulated. In Washington County, 3 inches of snow was measured near Reno, with under an inch in Marietta. In Jackson County, the city of Jackson was hit hard where the cooperative observer measured 3 to 4 inches of snow in less than 2 hours, however the southern part of the county only got a couple inches.","","CSV"

The incoming cold air was shallow, with warmer conditions (above freezing) overhead. Any snow or sleet would surely melt aloft, but would likely turn to ice (freezing rain) upon reaching the ground. During the nighttime hours of the 6th and early on the 7th, a Winter Weather Advisory was posted across northern Arkansas, with an Ice Storm Warning and up to a quarter inch of ice in the northeast.  For the most part, moisture tended to build over the southern and eastern counties, and stayed out of the north. Any ice in the north was minor and spotty. In the northeast, while there was some ice on trees and power lines (leading to spotty power outages), temperatures did not go much below 32 degrees and roads were generally wet.","Light ice accumulations were noted on trees.  Roads were mostly clear, with a few localized patches of ice.","CSV"

There was a narrow band that experienced a brief period of very heavy snow, with reports of 1 to 2 inches accumulating in an hour. This band was across portions of Wood, Pleasants, Ritchie and Tyler Counties. Even across individual counties, snowfall accumulations varied drastically based on the location of the heaviest band. For example, in Wood County, a member social media postings indicated 3 to 4 inches of snow across the southern part of the county, while near Parkersburg the US Army Corps of Engineers measured 1.5 inches. In Ritchie County, the emergency manager measured 3 inches before the snow changed to rain. Pleasants and Tyler Counties saw 2 to 3 inches of snow measured by CoCoRaHS volunteers and social media users.||Colder air lingered a bit longer across the higher mountains, namely in Pocahontas County where 3 to 6 inches of snow fell. For example, the cooperative observer at Snowshoe measured 6 inches, 5 inches of snow fell in near Bartow, and the observer in Frost received 4 inches.","","CSV"

This occurred along and ahead of a slow moving frontal boundary as generally between 1.5 and 4.5 inches of rain fell across eastern Kentucky. The hardest hit area was Harlan County, where flooding occurred across much of the county as up to 5.5 inches of rain fell. A state of emergency was declared as the Cumberland River at Baxter reached major flood stage, prompting the closure of all of the city of Harlan's floodgates. The floodgate for the city of Pikeville was also closed as the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River breached 38 feet. Additional emergency declarations were made in Bell, Clay, Floyd, Knott, Knox, Leslie, Letcher, and Perry Counties, as well as for the city of Pineville, as numerous tributaries and the main stems of the Kentucky, Cumberland, and Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy Rivers exceeded bankfull.||Nearly 2,200 power outages were blamed on the widespread flooding, while thousands of boil water advisories were issued as shelters were opened to provide water. Several bridges were also inspected by engineers for structural integrity as the flood waters receded. A number of water rescues took place during the weekend and into Monday morning, including nearly half a dozen in and around Hazard. Hundreds of people were forced from their homes as river flooding along portions of the Kentucky and Cumberland Rivers continued well into the following week.

In addition, it is believed mesoscale bands of heavy snow that affected portions of North-Central Montana on the 8th into early morning of the 9th were tied to frontogenesis in the 850 mb to 700 mb layer.","Montana DOT reported severe driving conditions on US-87 from Loma to Big Sandy.","CSV"

A deep southwest flow aloft was present along and behind the front across the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley, with weak embedded disturbances in the flow helping to enhance the development of scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms along and behind the front on the 21st. A warm, moist, and weakly unstable air mass had already spread north ahead of the front into Northeast Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana, with the southwest flow aloft tapping into the subtropical jet, thus transporting Pacific moisture northeast along and behind the front. Periods of moderate to at times, heavy rainfall fell along and behind the front across North Louisiana, and persisted through the early morning hours on the 23rd before diminishing. Widespread rainfall amounts of four to in excess of eight inches fell across North Louisiana from the morning hours of February 21st through the early morning hours on the 23rd.

A warm, moist, and weakly unstable air mass had already spread north ahead of the front into Northeast Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana, with the southwest flow aloft tapping into the subtropical jet, thus transporting Pacific moisture northeast along and behind the front.

Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties. The highest observed rainfall total was in Walton County, where a 48-hour rainfall total of 11.45 inches was recorded. Across southeast Alabama and portions of southwest Georgia, widespread 6 to 8 inches of rain fell. While one Flash Flood Warning was issued, the majority of the impacts from this event were from moderate rainfall rates over a prolonged period of time as convection trained across the tri-state area.

At 700 mb, a low- to mid-level shortwave trough shifted from Idaho and vicinity to eastern Montana. Simultaneously, a low pressure center developed within this shortwave. Horizontal wind shear associated with the counter-clockwise, inward circulation of this low led to weak 850-700 mb frontogenesis and associated ascent over North-Central and Southwest Montana. Large-scale ascent associated with the aforementioned frontogenesis and upper-level divergence ahead of the shortwave trough, combined with sufficient moisture, led to the development of snow over the region. At the surface, a front meandered near the Rocky Mountain Front and the mountains near Great Falls. This front separated cold air to its north from relatively-milder air to its south. This system delivered significant snow amounts to portions of North-Central and Southwest Montana, while the heaviest snow was focused east of I-15. While snow fell March 3rd through 5th, the bulk of accumulation occurred on the 3rd and 4th. In addition, Great Falls set a new snowfall record for March 4th (5.1 inches).

The weight of the ice resulted in some downed tree branches across the area.  ||The heavy sleet and freezing rain abated by the early afternoon on February 21 and became freezing drizzle as it continued across the remainder of West Central Texas, south of Interstate 20 during the night of February 21 and into the morning on February 22.  This continued to cause ice to accumulate on some roads, bridges, elevated objects and trees.  ||These conditions lead to a multiple vehicle pileup on Interstate 10 near Sonora.  Many school districts across West Central Texas began school about two hours late on February 22.","A multiple vehicle pileup occurred on Interstate 10 on the morning of February 22 around 6 AM between Mile Markers 400 and 401 near Sonora.  Vehicles involved were cars, pickups, commercial tractor trailers and pumpers.  They were scattered across the median as well as east and west bound lanes of the interstate at two separate sites.  This resulted in the closing of about 3 miles of Interstate 10 through noon.   Traffic was rerouted.  There were some injuries, but no fatalities.","CSV"

Large-scale ascent associated with the aforementioned frontogenesis and upper-level divergence ahead of the shortwave trough, combined with sufficient moisture, led to the development of snow over the region.
