The first was a round of light to moderate snow after midnight on 6th to around sunrise, which resulted in one to five inches of snow along and north of the I-88/I-90 corridor. Then, periods of freezing rain occurred from the afternoon of the 6th into the morning of the 7th mainly along and north of I-90. Reports of a quarter to a half an inch of ice accretion were received in the western Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondacks into Washington County. The freezing rain quickly turned to heavy snow during the afternoon of the 7th as a strong low pressure system passed south of the area. This round of snow resulted in a quick 6-12 inches of accumulation in the Mohawk Valley, southern Adirondacks, and Lake George Saratoga Region, with snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. In the wake of the snowfall, westerly winds gusted to 40-55 miles per hour in the afternoon and evening of the 7th, highest south of I-90.||The weight of the heavy snow and ice on trees along with strong winds resulted in numerous reports of downed trees and powerlines. Nearly 90,000 customers lost power, with Saratoga (46,000) and Warren (22,000) Counties being hit the hardest. Over half of Warren County was without power, prompting warming shelters to be opened. Several accidents occurred due to the snowy and icy roads across the southern Adirondacks and Lake George Saratoga Region, including one fatality in Mayfield, and major damage to a fire engine in Chester. A man in Lake Luzerne was injured when he was pierced in the leg while driving a vehicle, and a Thurman Highway Department truck was damaged when a tree fell onto it. Travel was discouraged due to the conditions in Saratoga Springs.","","CSV"

The hurricane spun slowly but steadily into southern Kenedy and northern Hidalgo County through just after midnight on the 26th, then through Starr County as a Tropical Storm before moving into Tamaulipas before daybreak and eventually near Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, by noon before dissipating during the evening of the 26th. Following the passage of the inner eye wall, broad feeder bands of torrential rains and gusty tropical storm force winds continued through the mid to late morning hours of July 26th, slowly migrating from east to west across the populated Rio Grande Valley. ||Other than storm surge flooding, which peaked just north of Baffin Bay on the Kleberg and Nueces County coast near Corpus Christi, Hanna's memory for the Rio Grande Valley will be flooding rainfall, power outages, and an array of damage to poorly constructed buildings, from minor roof damage to complete demolition.  Between 8 and 15 inches of rain fell from Port Mansfield to Harlingen, and along Interstate Highway 2 out through Mission and Sullivan City. The combination of high rainfall, locally high rainfall rates, and poor drainage left between 18 inches and four feet of water depth in many areas, most commonly from western Cameron through southeastern Hidalgo County, as well as a separate pocket in the Mission/La Joya/Sullivan City area. The rainfall wiped out 95% of the region's cotton crop; the combination of crop loss and production loss was more than one third of a billion dollars alone ($366 million)...most of which was in the Rio Grande Valley region.  ||At the peak of the storm, 250 thousand electric customers were without power, including all of Willacy County. Though storm surge was cut short by strong westerly flow across Cameron County, radiating swells did produce a notable surge of 3 feet or greater (estimated) from near Port Mansfield through Kenedy County. When the damage and economic loss is counted to infrastructure and agriculture combined, it is likely that Hanna cost at least one billion dollars across the Rio Grande Valley and the Deep S. Texas ranch country.","Hurricane Hanna made landfall along the Kenedy county|coast on the evening of July 25, 2020. As Hanna pushed inland, its|eastern outer rain bands produced several areas of rotation. One|area of stronger rotation developed south of Brownsville just across|the Rio Grande in Mexico. The Brownsville radar briefly detected|a debris signature as it moved northward toward the Brownsville|airport. The Brownsville airport, in addition to residents in|nearby neighborhoods, reported wind damage.||The initial touchdown was discovered about 2.3 miles south |of Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport.  Here, an|empty tractor trailer was moved on an angle into a stand of trees, |an unanchored travel trailer was flipped, a storage shed was flattened,|and several mesquite trees lost large limbs. A few minutes later, several |areas of damage occurred on the west side of the Brownsville airport. |A dozen windows were blown out of an airplane hangar building, an|unanchored old jet staircase was flipped and a garage door|collapsed inward. In addition, a Boeing 737 aircraft was moved into a|hangar, causing damage to the hangar wall. No damage was noted to|the plane itself. As the tornado moved to the north northwest,|several large tree limbs were snapped, in addition to a weak|uprooted tree. Finally further north, two homes lost large sections|of their roofs with most walls still standing. The brief tornado|then lifted with no other tornado damage found.||Based on the survey and quality of construction materials surveyed, the tornado was rated EF0 with peak winds of 75 mph.","CSV"

These storms diminished during the late afternoon, but a deepening upper level trough sweeping southeast across Oklahoma and Arkansas reinforced a cold front southeast across the Southern Plains and Ozarks region, where a complex of showers and thunderstorms developed by mid and late afternoon over these areas and quickly progressed southeast into the Four State Region. Despite the showers and thunderstorms that affected the area earlier in the day, instability remained adequate especially over East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, and adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas. As large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough, thus tapping into this unstable air, a squall line progressed southeast through all of the region during the late evening through the early morning hours on April 29th, producing widespread reports of damaging winds and large hail. A couple of isolated tornadoes also touched down across McCurtain County Oklahoma, one associated with the supercell that developed ahead of the line, and another associated within the squall line itself.

Town Creek overflowed its banks in the city of Pickens and inundated and caused significant damage to an industrial park that was in the process of being converted to new business sites. Two people had to be rescued from this location. Other roads were flooded and closed throughout the county due to a combination of drainage and small stream flooding. Dozens of roads were closed at the height of the event.","CSV"

Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches resulted in flooding persisting along some main stem rivers and larger streams well into the 7th.","NWS storm survey found the damage path of an EF2 tornado that began just west of I-85 near Lane St where trees were snapped and uprooted as the tornado crossed the interstate and moved east along Lane St. The awning of a service station was also damaged. The tornado then moved along Old Salisbury-Concord Rd snapping and uprooting trees until it reached Gold Fish Rd where several homes were damaged. The tornado then moved east along Irish Potato Rd snapping and uprooting trees. Farther along this road another home was damaged. Little damage was noted as the tornado moved east until it crossed Dutch Buffalo Creek where trees were snapped and uprooted.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","Several trees were blown down and there was damage to four structures around Drew. One tree fell onto a home and trapped a family. However, there were no injuries.","CSV"

As it did, a surface low deepened and moved east across Kansas pushing a cold front south across the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles before moving into western Texas. The cold front moved into the Oklahoma Panhandle early in the morning and quickly swept south through through the Texas Panhandle, continuing to move across the region. A strong pressure gradient between the low over Kansas and high pressure surging southeast out of Colorado created very strong winds across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles behind the front, which lasted into the early evening.||Across the northern half of the Texas Panhandle, sustained winds increased into the 40 to greater than 50 MPH range out of the north to northwest, with gusts mainly in the 55 to 65 MPH range. Farther south, sustained winds generally ranged from 37 to 46 MPH with gusts mainly in the 50 to 60 MPH range. These strong winds lasted most of the day before finally diminishing from west to east beginning in the late afternoon. Although the relative humidity was only 15 to 35 percent across the northwestern two-thirds of the Texas Panhandle, the high winds and dry fuels associated with recent onset of moderate to extreme drought in the area led to a high wildfire danger across part of the region.","The West Texas Mesonet station 1 mile north-northwest of Stinnett measured gusts in the 58 to 66 MPH range during this time period. The highest gusts of 66 MPH occurred at 1527 and 1543CST.","CSV"

As it did, a surface low deepened and moved east across Kansas pushing a cold front south across the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles before moving into western Texas. The cold front moved into the Oklahoma Panhandle early in the morning and quickly swept south through through the Texas Panhandle, continuing to move across the region. A strong pressure gradient between the low over Kansas and high pressure surging southeast out of Colorado created very strong winds across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles behind the front, which lasted into the early evening.||Across the northern half of the Texas Panhandle, sustained winds increased into the 40 to greater than 50 MPH range out of the north to northwest, with gusts mainly in the 55 to 65 MPH range. Farther south, sustained winds generally ranged from 37 to 46 MPH with gusts mainly in the 50 to 60 MPH range. These strong winds lasted most of the day before finally diminishing from west to east beginning in the late afternoon. Although the relative humidity was only 15 to 35 percent across the northwestern two-thirds of the Texas Panhandle, the high winds and dry fuels associated with recent onset of moderate to extreme drought in the area led to a high wildfire danger across part of the region.","The West Texas Mesonet station 12 miles southwest of Claude measured sustained winds in the 40 to 42 MPH range during this time period.

The period May 16 to June 25 was exceedingly dry. There was some relief in late June and July, especially in the White Mountains and parts of southwest New Hampshire due to thunderstorm activity. By the middle of August, dry conditions set in again with September being exceedingly dry with some locations reporting their driest September on record. The National Centers for Environmental Information reported that September was the 7th driest on record for New Hampshire. D2 severe drought was confined to coastal New Hampshire, the Merrimack River Valley and the Lakes Region during the beginning of the month. The D2 severe drought rapidly expanded through the entire state by the end of September. An area of D3 extreme drought area developing towards the end of September in Southeast New Hampshire with Strafford County being the hardest hit, along with regions of surrounding counties.  The drought peaked in intensity during the first week of October before beneficial widespread rains impacted the state towards the middle of October.  Concord received a monthly rainfall total of 5.11, Manchester received 4.01, Whitfield received 5.48, and Durham received 4.59.  Towards the middle of the month most of Coos County was reduced from D2 Severe Drought to D1 Moderate Drought.  Drought classification continued to improve by the third week in October due to the heavy rains. Grafton, Sullivan, and Cheshire Counties were reduced from D2 Severe Drought to D1 Moderate Drought. The northern and western sections of Carroll, Belknap, Merrimack and Hillsborough Counties also showed a drought classification improvement by the end of the month. Severe and Extreme drought remained across southeast New Hampshire through the end of the month.","The drought peaked in intensity during the first week of October before beneficial widespread rains impacted the state towards the middle of October. Concord received a monthly rainfall total of 5.11, Manchester received 4.01, Whitefield received 5.48, and Durham received 4.59. Even with the October rainfall, deficits since Jan 1st remained at -9.77 at Concord, -10.66 at Whitefield and -12.42 at Manchester. Drought monitor classifications in October had a positive trend or maintained with no worsening of drought conditions in part of the state.  During the first week of October 95% of the state was in D2 Severe drought and 22% of the state was in D3 Extreme drought.  By the end of the month the areal extent of D2 Severe drought had decreased to 33% of the state and D3 Extreme drought decreased to 17% of the state.  Overall, the greatest improvements were across Northern and Western New Hampshire, where D1 Moderate drought remained.  Severe and Extreme drought remained centered across southeast New Hampshire by the end of the month.  Hydrologic conditions continued to worsen in the first week of October on non-regulated rivers with 81% of USGS river gaging stations below normal and 9% of sites at record lows for the beginning of October.  Hydrologic conditions began to improve by mid-month due to the heavy rainfall with most river basins near the normal range by the end of October. Reservoir levels continued to trend below normal on the upper Connecticut River along with Lake Winnipesaukee which remained half a foot below normal by the end of the month. Overall lake levels were on par with the 2016 drought. In New Hampshire of the monitoring wells maintained by the USGS and the state of New Hampshire, the majority were below average with record low levels across southeast New Hampshire for the date. Numerous water bans and restrictions remained in effect during the month of October with virtually all towns in Southern and Central New Hampshire having issued a water ban impacting 400,000 residents.  An estimated 1000 private residents had dry wells with state agencies reporting over 100 applicants fore well assistance. Corn, potatoes, barley fruit crops and forage crops were the most affected. Farmers were concerned about having enough forage for their livestock to get through the winter. Dairy industry was especially impacted due to low grass yields.","CSV"

Further south, shear and forcing were a bit weaker. However, thunderstorms eventually progressed southward into the mid-Atlantic, fueled in part by outflow from storms to the north.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","This tornado began in far northern Richland Parish east of the intersection of LA Highways 134 and 183. It crossed into southwestern West Carroll Parish, crossing Fusilier Rd, Gwin Rd, LA Highway 134, Duckworth Rd, and Sharplin Rd before crossing and ending just northeast of Waller Rd. Along the path, several trees were uprooted and multiple irrigation pivots were flipped. The total path length was 6.18 miles. The maximum estimated winds of the tornado occurred in West Carroll Parish at 105 mph. The maximum width was 700 yards.","CSV"

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","At least 20 trees were blown down across the county, some of which fell onto homes.","CSV"

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","A swath of downed trees along a narrow path consistent with tornado damage was noted on satellite imagery in an area of the Delta National Forest.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","A tornado briefly touched down in western Choctaw County.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","This tornado began along US 45, uprooting trees as it tracked northward along the highway. Two homes sustained minor roof damage and additional trees were uprooted along Springhill Loop. The tornado uprooted additional trees along Crescent Lake Rd before lifting.

The main corridor of focused and higher end wind damage was across southern Copiah to far southern Simpson, as well as all of northern sections of Lawrence, Jefferson Davis and Covington counties before dissipating across northwest Jones County. Based on a NWS damage survey of portions of this swath, along with accounts and assessments from local Emergency Managers, significant wind speeds across this swath ranged between 80 and 100 mph. Within the overall swath, there were generally 2 to 3 focused corridors, roughly running from west northwest to east southeast, where the greatest concentration of damage occurred. General dimensions of the swath can be described as roughly 80 miles long with a width of 6 to 8 miles where the greatest concentration of damage occurred. Damage across this large swath were primarily damaged trees and downed power lines. Tree damage was a combination of uprooted and snapped trees and was quite extensive and best characterized by hundreds of thousands of damaged trees. Downed power lines and broken poles were extensive as well across the swath. Additionally, many structures were damaged with degrees of damage from minor to major. All of this was due to a combination of the wind itself causing damage or by downed trees damaging the structure.","CSV"

This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","Trees were blown down.","CSV"

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes.

Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama.

Flash flooding also occurred with efficient rainfall rates and heavy rainfall. As the cold front moved through the region later during the afternoon of the 23rd, a few more storms developed during peak daytime heating and brought some hail and damaging winds to portions of eastern Mississippi.","During the late evening, a severe thunderstorm was responsible for an extensive swath of significant damage across several counties in the southern portion of the NWS Jackson service area. The main corridor of focused and higher end wind damage was across southern Copiah to far southern Simpson, as well as all of northern sections of Lawrence, Jefferson Davis and Covington counties before dissipating across northwest Jones County. Based on a NWS damage survey of portions of this swath, along with accounts and assessments from local Emergency Managers, significant wind speeds across this swath ranged between 80 and 100 mph. Within the overall swath, there were generally 2 to 3 focused corridors, roughly running from west northwest to east southeast, where the greatest concentration of damage occurred. General dimensions of the swath can be described as roughly 80 miles long with a width of 6 to 8 miles where the greatest concentration of damage occurred. Damage across this large swath were primarily damaged trees and downed power lines. Tree damage was a combination of uprooted and snapped trees and was quite extensive and best characterized by hundreds of thousands of damaged trees. Downed power lines and broken poles were extensive as well across the swath. Additionally, many structures were damaged with degrees of damage from minor to major.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","Trees were blown down.","CSV"

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","A swath of wind caused damage from Duncan to Shaw. This included trees and power lines blown down across Duncan and Shelby. The most intense damage occurred from just Merigold to Shaw. In Merigold, around one dozen power poles were snapped along Crosby Road. A tree was also blown down onto a house in Merigold. Some limbs were blown down on the north side of Cleveland, but the worst damage occurred in and south of Cleveland. A wall collapsed at Parks Elementary School and the roof was blown off. Nearby trees were blown down. Trees were blown down along Memorial Drive and light poles were broken on US Highway 61. The tree damage around Cleveland was the worst in a two block wide corridor and some trees were blown down onto houses. Several trees were blown onto and damaged houses and vehicles in Boyle. Some shingles were lost on homes in the area and power lines were blown down. In Shaw, some small to large tree limbs were blown down and the north facing tin wall of an old mechanic shop was torn off.","CSV"

In addition, strong wind gusts from 59 to 71 mph not associated with the derecho, occurred prior to and following the passage of this system over the urban corridor and plains of northeast Colorado.||By midday the derecho, which originated over the Great Basin, moved over the northern and central mountains, and then rapidly northeast across the I-25 corridor by mid afternoon.  These storms then tracked across the plains from late afternoon into the early evening hours.  Wind gusts from 60 to 80 mph were common with a few gusts exceeding 90 mph.  The highest gust observed was 110 mph, at the Winter Park Ski area, around 12000 feet.  Xcel Energy said in a press release that more than 208,000 customers lost power because of the storm statewide.

The period May 16 to June 25 was exceedingly dry. There was some relief in late June and July, especially in the White Mountains and parts of southwest New Hampshire due to thunderstorm activity. By the middle of August, dry conditions set in again with September being exceedingly dry with some locations reporting their driest September on record. The National Centers for Environmental Information reported that September was the 7th driest on record for New Hampshire. D2 severe drought was confined to coastal New Hampshire, the Merrimack River Valley and the Lakes Region during the beginning of the month. The D2 severe drought rapidly expanded through the entire state by the end of September. An area of D3 extreme drought area developing towards the end of September in Southeast New Hampshire with Strafford County being the hardest hit, along with regions of surrounding counties.  The drought peaked in intensity during the first week of October before beneficial widespread rains impacted the state towards the middle of October.  Concord received a monthly rainfall total of 5.11, Manchester received 4.01, Whitfield received 5.48, and Durham received 4.59.  Towards the middle of the month most of Coos County was reduced from D2 Severe Drought to D1 Moderate Drought.  Drought classification continued to improve by the third week in October due to the heavy rains. Grafton, Sullivan, and Cheshire Counties were reduced from D2 Severe Drought to D1 Moderate Drought. The northern and western sections of Carroll, Belknap, Merrimack and Hillsborough Counties also showed a drought classification improvement by the end of the month. Severe and Extreme drought remained across southeast New Hampshire through the end of the month.","The drought peaked in intensity during the first week of October before beneficial widespread rains impacted the state towards the middle of October. Concord received a monthly rainfall total of 5.11, Manchester received 4.01, Whitefield received 5.48, and Durham received 4.59. Even with the October rainfall, deficits since Jan 1st remained at -9.77 at Concord, -10.66 at Whitefield and -12.42 at Manchester. Drought monitor classifications in October had a positive trend or maintained with no worsening of drought conditions in part of the state.  During the first week of October 95% of the state was in D2 Severe drought and 22% of the state was in D3 Extreme drought.  By the end of the month the areal extent of D2 Severe drought had decreased to 33% of the state and D3 Extreme drought decreased to 17% of the state.  Overall, the greatest improvements were across Northern and Western New Hampshire, where D1 Moderate drought remained.  Severe and Extreme drought remained centered across southeast New Hampshire by the end of the month.  Hydrologic conditions continued to worsen in the first week of October on non-regulated rivers with 81% of USGS river gaging stations below normal and 9% of sites at record lows for the beginning of October.  Hydrologic conditions began to improve by mid-month due to the heavy rainfall with most river basins near the normal range by the end of October. Reservoir levels continued to trend below normal on the upper Connecticut River along with Lake Winnipesaukee which remained half a foot below normal by the end of the month. Overall lake levels were on par with the 2016 drought. In New Hampshire of the monitoring wells maintained by the USGS and the state of New Hampshire, the majority were below average with record low levels across southeast New Hampshire for the date. Numerous water bans and restrictions remained in effect during the month of October with virtually all towns in Southern and Central New Hampshire having issued a water ban impacting 400,000 residents.  An estimated 1000 private residents had dry wells with state agencies reporting over 100 applicants fore well assistance. Corn, potatoes, barley fruit crops and forage crops were the most affected. Farmers were concerned about having enough forage for their livestock to get through the winter. Dairy industry was especially impacted due to low grass yields.","CSV"

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.","This weak tornado started on the south side of Lake Providence and moved north-northeast through the middle of the city. Tree damage was minor and sporadic. Several buildings near City Hall were damaged with minor roof damage and some bricks fell from an exterior wall. The tornado lifted just after cross the levee by the city dump. Maximum estimated winds were 85 mph.","CSV"

The period May 16 to June 25 was exceedingly dry. There was some relief in late June and July, especially in the White Mountains and parts of southwest New Hampshire due to thunderstorm activity. By the middle of August, dry conditions set in again with September being exceedingly dry with some locations reporting their driest September on record. The National Centers for Environmental Information reported that September was the 7th driest on record for New Hampshire. D2 severe drought was confined to coastal New Hampshire, the Merrimack River Valley and the Lakes Region during the beginning of the month. The D2 severe drought rapidly expanded through the entire state by the end of September. An area of D3 extreme drought area developing towards the end of September in Southeast New Hampshire with Strafford County being the hardest hit, along with regions of surrounding counties.  The drought peaked in intensity during the first week of October before beneficial widespread rains impacted the state towards the middle of October.  Concord received a monthly rainfall total of 5.11, Manchester received 4.01, Whitfield received 5.48, and Durham received 4.59.  Towards the middle of the month most of Coos County was reduced from D2 Severe Drought to D1 Moderate Drought.  Drought classification continued to improve by the third week in October due to the heavy rains. Grafton, Sullivan, and Cheshire Counties were reduced from D2 Severe Drought to D1 Moderate Drought. The northern and western sections of Carroll, Belknap, Merrimack and Hillsborough Counties also showed a drought classification improvement by the end of the month. Severe and Extreme drought remained across southeast New Hampshire through the end of the month.","The drought peaked in intensity during the first week of October before beneficial widespread rains impacted the state towards the middle of October. Concord received a monthly rainfall total of 5.11, Manchester received 4.01, Whitefield received 5.48, and Durham received 4.59. Even with the October rainfall, deficits since Jan 1st remained at -9.77 at Concord, -10.66 at Whitefield and -12.42 at Manchester. Drought monitor classifications in October had a positive trend or maintained with no worsening of drought conditions in part of the state.  During the first week of October 95% of the state was in D2 Severe drought and 22% of the state was in D3 Extreme drought.  By the end of the month the areal extent of D2 Severe drought had decreased to 33% of the state and D3 Extreme drought decreased to 17% of the state.  Overall, the greatest improvements were across Northern and Western New Hampshire, where D1 Moderate drought remained.  Severe and Extreme drought remained centered across southeast New Hampshire by the end of the month.  Hydrologic conditions continued to worsen in the first week of October on non-regulated rivers with 81% of USGS river gaging stations below normal and 9% of sites at record lows for the beginning of October.  Hydrologic conditions began to improve by mid-month due to the heavy rainfall with most river basins near the normal range by the end of October. Reservoir levels continued to trend below normal on the upper Connecticut River along with Lake Winnipesaukee which remained half a foot below normal by the end of the month. Overall lake levels were on par with the 2016 drought. In New Hampshire of the monitoring wells maintained by the USGS and the state of New Hampshire, the majority were below average with record low levels across southeast New Hampshire for the date. Numerous water bans and restrictions remained in effect during the month of October with virtually all towns in Southern and Central New Hampshire having issued a water ban impacting 400,000 residents.  An estimated 1000 private residents had dry wells with state agencies reporting over 100 applicants fore well assistance. Corn, potatoes, barley fruit crops and forage crops were the most affected. Farmers were concerned about having enough forage for their livestock to get through the winter. Dairy industry was especially impacted due to low grass yields.","CSV"

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred.

One of these supercells formed near the Mississippi River in west Tennessee, then tracked eastward across the entire length of the state just north of the Interstate 40 corridor, spawning 10 tornadoes and dropping large hail bigger than the size of baseballs. Seven of these tornadoes touched down across Middle Tennessee, resulting in widespread damage, 307 injuries and 24 fatalities. An additional fatality and 2 more injuries occurred in Benton County in west Tennessee. These tornadoes were the worst seen in Tennessee since the devastating tornadoes of April 27, 2011 across east Tennessee, as well as the Super Tuesday tornadoes of February 5-6, 2008. Total damage estimates from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency across Middle Tennessee reached $1.6 billion.","An historic, violent EF-4 tornado began in western Putnam County northwest of Baxter and tracked eastward for over 8 miles before lifting near downtown Cookeville, damaging or destroying dozens of homes and businesses, killing 19 people, and injuring 88 others. The tornado began 2.5 miles northwest of Baxter along Highway 70 where it caused EF-0 damage to several homes and outbuildings. Scattered trees were blown down as the tornado continued eastward across Gainesboro Highway. The tornado quickly intensified to EF-2 in the Prosperity Pointe subdivision just north of Highway 70 and further strengthened to EF-3 as it crossed Bloomington Road and Clemmons Road in the Double Springs community, severely damaging several homes. As the tornado moved across Charleston Square, Plunk Whitson Road, and North McBloom Chapel Road, it intensified even more and produced a 0.8 mile long by 100 yards wide swath of EF-4 damage. 17 well-constructed, large homes in this area were completely leveled, mostly on Hensley Drive, with many deaths occurring in this area. EF-4 damage continued eastward to Echo Valley Drive, where an apartment complex and 5 more homes were completely destroyed. The tornado weakened to EF-3 as it crossed Highway 70 and Locust Grove Road, where numerous more homes and buildings were damaged or destroyed. A dashcam video of the tornado was taken from an unoccupied vehicle on Willow Brook Drive in this area. Continuing along Highway 70, the tornado weakened further to EF-2 intensity as it crossed County Farm Road and Jackson Street, then down to EF-1 strength along Crescent Drive and Buck Avenue. The tornado rapdily dissipated as it entered the downtown area of Cookeville, quickly lifting on Laurel Avenue just west of Cookeville Regional Medical Center. This was the worst tornado on record to affect Putnam County.","CSV"

The low pressure ultimately tracked from near Atlantic City, NJ to about 50 miles south of Fire Island, NY before sliding offshore Thursday December 17, 2020. This track led to warmer air aloft moving over the NYC metro and Long Island, changing the snow to a mixture of sleet and rain. Surface temperatures briefly warmed into the upper 30s across central and eastern Long Island early on December 17, 2020, changing the precipitation to plain rain. Once the low began moving away from Long Island, temperatures fell significantly below freezing with snow returning as the event ended. Any snowmelt and standing water refroze on Long Island. Any mixed precipitation was brief in the NYC metro and predominately snow fell across the Lower Hudson Valley. The storm significantly impacted travel during the evening commute on Wednesday December 16, 2020 and the morning commute on Thursday December 17, 2020. Many accidents resulted from the snow and icy conditions. Snowfall rates ranged from 1 to 2 inches per hour Wednesday evening. Total snowfall ranged from around 4 inches across coastal southeast Long Island to as much as 14 inches in Orange County.  6 to 12 inches of snow fell in the NYC metro. Strong wind gusts also occurred with the storm, 35 to 60 mph, with some coastal stations reporting gusts as high as 74 mph on Long Island.","A CoCoRaHS observer 2 miles east of Yorktown Heights measured 11 inches of snow and a CoCORaHS observer 2 miles south of Peach Lake measured 10.9 inches of snow.
