The Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer Conservation District was in stage 3 alarm drought status.","June was feast or famine for rainfall across South Central Texas. Most of the region had less than 50 percent of normal. However, the southwestern corner of the area received in excess of 150 percent of normal and parts of Maverick and Dimmit Counties had as much as four times normal. This rain allowed Kinney (now in extreme drought category, Stage D3), Dimmit (severe category, Stage D2), Maverick (D2), and Zavala (D2) Counties to improve their drought conditions. At the same time, the lack of rain led to drought conditions worsening to stage D3 in Bastrop and Lee Counties, and to stage D2 in Blanco, Burnet, Caldwell, Comal, Fayette, Gonzales, Guadalupe, Hays, Kendall, and Travis Counties. Val Verde (D4), Edwards (D3), Bandera (D2), De Witt (D2), Frio (D2), Gillespie (D2), Kerr (D2), Llano (D2), Medina (D2), Real (D2), Uvalde (D2), and Williamson (D2) Counties all remained unchanged from May. Fire danger at the end of the month was moderate. Of the counties in D2 or worse drought Caldwell, Dimmit, Edwards, Fayette, Frio, Kinney, Lee, Llano, Maverick, Medina, and Val Verde had outdoor burn bans in effect at the end of the month. The seven day stream flow averages were much below normal (less than 10 percent) across the Colorado River basin. The Upper and Middle Guadalupe, Nueces, Rio Grande, and Frio River basins were reporting below normal (10 to 24 percent) flow. Area lakes and reservoirs continued well below normal pool elevations. Lake Amistad was around 59 feet below normal. Lake Travis was 54 feet below normal and Medina Lake 83 feet below normal which left it at 5 percent of capacity. The Edwards Aquifer was nearly 17 feet below normal, and 3.2 feet below the level at the end of June 2012. Uvalde was in stage 5 water restrictions, Austin was in stage 2, and Kerrville, San Marcos, and Seguin were in stage 1.

Peak winds were estimated at 75 mph.  Damage was almost entirely from downed trees.  In that regard numerous homes and a few parked vehicles were damaged by trees falling onto them.  ||First damage was noted near the Bretton Woods golf course along River Road.  Damage continued along Bonnie Dale Drive and Glenhurst Ct where several trees were downed in the community.  Also, near the intersection of Turkey Foot Road and Jones Lane in southwest Montgomery County near North Potomac MD a few large trees were over the road.  The tornado raced east at nearly 60 mph to the northern section of Rockville MD.  At least 14 homes were significantly damaged by uprooted trees.  As it continued east to the Norbeck and Aspen Hill area 30 trees were uprooted in the Manor County Golf Club as well as numerous homes damaged in the surrounding communiteis from tree damage.  Tree damage was noted along the intercounty connector route 200 at the Layhill Road exit.  Finally a few trees were downed in Spencerville and Burtonsville.||Additionally there was a parallel 7 miles path of damage through South Rockville and Glenmont MD with similar tree damage.  This area was found to be straight line winds from the outflow just south of the tornado from the parent supercell storm.","CSV"

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","An intensifying thunderstorm moved across the eastern portion of Collingsworth County during the late afternoon hours. As the thunderstorm approached Wellington (Collingsworth County) from the southwest it passed over a residence 6 mile southwest of Wellington and produced quarter size hail. No property damage accompanied this report.","CSV"

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A thunderstorm moved over the city of Wellington (Collingsworth County) shortly before 5 pm on the 29th.

The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A thunderstorm moved over the city of Wellington (Collingsworth County) shortly before 5 pm on the 29th.

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A thunderstorm moved over the city of Wellington (Collingsworth County) shortly before 5 pm on the 29th.

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A Collingsworth County Sheriff officer 2 miles west of Dozier (Collingsworth County) reported a 60 mph gust from a squall line as it moved east across the county.

However, the forcing was not sufficient for this convection to overcome the strong nocturnal inversion and tap into the marginal elevated instability. The strong deep layer shear easily toppled developing thunderstorms which led to isolated downbursts as thunderstorms collapsed. The shortwave quickly moved to the east, shifting the favorable environment for development out of the Texas Panhandle by the late morning hours.","A thunderstorm developed over southern Randall County during the mid-morning hours of the 21st.

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A rapidly intensifying supercell moved to the northeast across southern Grey County. A storm chaser traveling north along US Highway 70 intercepted the storm south of the Farm to Market road 2447 and US Highway 70 intersection. The storm chaser reported that the supercell produced hen egg size hail on US Highway 70.

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A thunderstorm moved over the city of Wellington (Collingsworth County) shortly before 5 PM CST on the 29th. A storm chaser on 15th street near the Marian Airpark reported hen egg size hail as the storm passed over their location. No reports of damage accompanied this hail report.","CSV"

A shortwave trough rotated around the base of this system and helped initiate showers and thunderstorms over the southern Texas Panhandle. However, the forcing was not sufficient for this convection to overcome the strong nocturnal inversion and tap into the marginal elevated instability. The strong deep layer shear easily toppled developing thunderstorms which led to isolated downbursts as thunderstorms collapsed. The shortwave quickly moved to the east, shifting the favorable environment for development out of the Texas Panhandle by the late morning hours.","A thunderstorm developed over southern Randall County during the mid-morning hours of the 21st. As the thunderstorm moved to the northeast it encountered a strongly sheared environment which toppled the storm structure. The core of the thunderstorm collapsed 1 mile east of the city of Canyon (Randall County) causing a 61 mph downburst. This downburst was measured by a trained storm spotter near the West Texas A&M University Event Center.","CSV"

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","The West Texas Mesonet site 6 miles east of Canadian measured a 63 mph gust as a squall line moved toward Canadian.","CSV"

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A trained storm spotter reported nickle size hail in Howardwick (Donley County). The hail was produced from a developing squall line that stretched from Grey County to Hall County and moving to the east-northeast.","CSV"

The thunderstorms that developed along the surface trough formed into a broken linear structure due to areas of higher instability and stronger deep layer shear. The linear structure made the primary hazard for these storms damaging winds. A line of thunderstorms which moved through the southern Texas Panhandle during the overnight hours of the 16th and into the early morning hours of the 17th took on a classic bow echo signature. As a result, severe wind damage was noted in southern Randall County where the bow echo signature first developed. Thunderstorms moved to the southeast across the Panhandles before entering northwest Texas by 2 AM CST.","Discrete thunderstorms developed over the southern Texas Panhandle during the evening hours of the 16th and moved to the south-southeast across the Texas Panhandle. One of these thunderstorms moved over the city of Clarendon (Donley County). While over the city, a memeber of the public reported quarter size hail (1.00 inches). The thunderstorm continued to move to the south-southeast across the county after producing this hail.","CSV"

The tornado traveled east northeast to a farmstead on highway 187, blowing away a small outbuilding and peeling some metal panels off the roof of a larger shed. The tornado continued ENE to Busby Rd, where a portion of the roof was removed from a home. The house also shifted slightly on its foundation while a deck was lifted and tossed and a garage door caved in. The track has lost at this point, as the tornado moved over open fields. However, the path was picked up again at Mar-Mac Rd, near the Martin Rd intersection, where numerous trees were uprooted or snapped.

Morning upper air analysis on the 29th showed a mid-level trough centered from Idaho to New Mexico with a low level closed low over Colorado and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. The lift provided by both of these large scale forcing mechanisms would easily overcome the capping inversion in place across the eastern Texas Panhandle by the early afternoon. At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line. Several more reports of 60+ mph gusts and large hail were received by the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo (Potter County) as this squall line progressed out of the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma shortly after 5 pm CST.","A weakening embedded core within a squall line moving across Donely County produced hail 1 mile to the northeast of Clarendon.

After sunset the freezing rain gradually transitioned into sleet, then snow. By 9 pm Saturday night most of the area was receiving light to moderate snow. Areas north of Interstate 70 received about 6 to 8 inches of snow, with some locations reporting higher amounts. The highest official snow total the NWS received was 9.0 from spotters near St. Joseph and Grant City. The snow moved out of the area late Saturday night, leaving behind very slick roads and some minor damage caused by the ice.","Light to moderate snow picked up during the afternoon hours on December 21.

These thunderstorms moved eastward and entered the western Oklahoma Panhandle around the 6 PM CST hour. Higher instability and stronger deep layer shear provided an optimal environment for these storms to strengthen as they slowly progressed further into the Panhandle. Around 8:30 PM CST, a discrete supercell over southeast Colorado took a hard right turn to the southeast. As it moved towards the Oklahoma Panhandle, it underwent a transition from a discrete cell to a linear structure. Upon entering the central Oklahoma Panhandle, this line briefly merged with a discrete cell that was moving eastward across the southern portions of the Oklahoma Panhandle counties near the town of Guymon (Texas County). After this brief merger, both complexes continued to move across the Oklahoma Panhandle, and once again merged upon entering western Oklahoma by midnight of the 5th.

Much of the area received above normal rainfall and 14 counties moved to better than severe (Stage D2) drought. In addition, Bandera, Kerr, Medina, Real, Uvalde, and Williamson Counties improved a category to stage D2. All the other counties stayed the same with Kinney, Maverick, and Val Verde in exceptional (Stage D4) drought category, Dimmit, Edwards, and Zavala in extreme (Stage D3), and Bastrop, De Witt, Frio, Gillespie, Lee, and Llano in severe (Stage D2) category. Fire danger at the end of the month was low to moderate. Of the counties in D2 or worse drought seven had outdoor burn bans in effect at the end of the month. These were Dimmit, Edwards, Frio, Kinney, Maverick, Medina, and Val Verde. The seven day stream flow averages were much below normal (less than 10 percent) across the Colorado River basin. The Guadalupe, Nueces, Rio Grande, and Frio River basins were reporting below normal (10 to 24 percent) flow. Area lakes and reservoirs continued below normal pool elevations. Lake Amistad was around 61 feet below normal at 1056.3 feet which is a new record low for the lake. Lake Travis was 52 feet below normal and Medina Lake near 82 feet below normal which left it at 5.5 percent of capacity. The Edwards Aquifer saw some improvement from the rain in May, but was still 8 feet below normal, and 4.2 feet below the level at the end of May 2012. Uvalde was in stage 5 water restrictions and Kerrville was in stage 1.","May brought some much needed rain to South Central Texas.
