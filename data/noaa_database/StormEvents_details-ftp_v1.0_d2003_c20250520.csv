The wind and hail caused the most damage to crops in a 20 mile to 70 mile long area from north of Britton over to Sisseton and into west central Minnesota. Much of the crops were shredded to the ground. In fact, approximately 30 percent (70,000 acres) of Marshall counties 227,000 acres of crops were damaged or destroyed.  Cities receiving the most damage from the line of storms were, Hecla, Andover, Britton, Kidder, Veblen, Roslyn, Langford, Lake City, Claire City, Sisseton, Waubay, Rosholt, and Wilmot.  Storm damage mostly included, trees and branches down, power lines and poles down, roof and siding damage from hail and fallen trees, some farm outbuildings damaged or destroyed, and many windows broke out of homes and vehicles.  Also, many boats, docks, and campers received some damage in the path of the storms. Specifically, an aerial crop spraying plane at the Sisseton airport was picked up and thrown 450 feet and landed upside down. In Claire City, a 55,000 bushel grain bin was blown off of it's foundation and flattened.  On a farm five miles north of Amherst, three large grain bins were blown over and damaged.",,"PDS"

Much of the crops were shredded to the ground. In fact, approximately 30 percent (70,000 acres) of Marshall counties 227,000 acres of crops were damaged or destroyed.  Cities receiving the most damage from the line of storms were, Hecla, Andover, Britton, Kidder, Veblen, Roslyn, Langford, Lake City, Claire City, Sisseton, Waubay, Rosholt, and Wilmot.  Storm damage mostly included, trees and branches down, power lines and poles down, roof and siding damage from hail and fallen trees, some farm outbuildings damaged or destroyed, and many windows broke out of homes and vehicles.  Also, many boats, docks, and campers received some damage in the path of the storms. Specifically, an aerial crop spraying plane at the Sisseton airport was picked up and thrown 450 feet and landed upside down.

The peak wind gusts of the event mainly occurred during the afternoon. Numerous trees, tree limbs, transformers and wires were knocked down and damaged homes and vehicles. Scattered transformer fires occurred. In some instances poles were snapped. Numerous roads were closed including Interstate 295 and Delaware State Route 10. The afternoon and evening commute was difficult because of many closed roads. Emergency personnel had the added problem with road closures because the high winds were blowing away the plastic and wood road barriers.  Shingles, chimney covers,  gutters and siding were ripped from houses and fences were damaged by downed limbs and trees.  Vehicles were damaged by fallen trees and/or flying debris. Awnings were torn away, store windows damaged, roadway business signs were knocked down as were overhead traffic signs and traffic signals. Trash and recycling cans were tossed in the middle of roads. Some schools had early dismissal because of the lost power and many scholastic games were cancelled. The high winds made it very difficult to fight fires and led to blow out tides at times of low tide during the evening of the 13th and also on the 14th. Conectiv Energy reported about 46,600 of its customers lost power in its Delaware service area. All power was restored by 6 p.m. on the 15th.

In New Castle County, downed transmission lines forced the closure of Interstate 295 in both directions for two hours during the afternoon of the 13th.

The blow out tides left an oil refinery near Delaware City without enough cooling water late on the 13th and the 14th. This subsequently damaged the crude refining unit and caused sporadic pollution releases. The blow out tides left cooling water supplies nine to twelve feet below normal. Some pumps shut down and production was cut back and damaged the crude unit where oil was first processed. The crude unit also developed a leak.

Grace ended up being a heavy rain producer for portions of the Upper Texas Coast where some flooding was observed. There was no damage due to Grace's winds.Grace developed from a tropical wave that moved across the Yucatan Peninsula and into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico late on August 29th. Development was inhibited by strong vertical wind shear. On August 30th, the shear lessened and a tropical depression formed about 335 miles east southeast of Corpus Christi. Reports from a ship and a reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the cyclone had strengthened into Tropical Storm Grace later that day. Grace moved in a general northwestward direction and remained poorly organized until it made landfall along the Texas coast between Port O'Connor and Freeport on August 31st. The system continued to move inland and quickly weakened to a depression. Outer rain bands containing heavy rainfall continued to develop near the coast well after Grace had weakened and produced additional heavy rainfall that lead to some flooding. Heavy rainfall between 6 and 12 inches was observed from extreme eastern Galveston County to across the Bolivar Peninsula and northward into Chambers and portions of Liberty Counties. Some roads were flooded in these areas. Beach erosion was minor.

Additional thunderstorms formed into a broken west to east line across West Virginia, ahead of the squall line.  This caused flooding problems.  After 1500E, the squall line accelerated eastward, moving near 50 mph.  As a result of this event, a few more counties, such as Ritchie and Harrison, were added to FEMA's disaster declaration number 1474.   This federal disaster was initiated during the month of June.","Straight line winds caused localize damage along Avery Street in Parkersburg.  One frame house collapsed and several outbuilding were damaged.  The 3 residents in the collapsed house were injured slightly.  The 11 month son was rescued from under the debris.

Manhole covers popped off on streets in the Green Bay area (Brown co.) and Appleton (Outagamie co.).  A mall in downtown Green Bay had to be evacuated as water started to flow into the lower levels from the street.  A bridge over the Fox River in Neenah (Outagamie co.) had to be closed due to flooding.Strong winds downed trees and power lines in Winnebago county and tipped over a semi in Center Valley (Outagamie co.).  A 20 foot steel scaffolding, that had been set up to repair a chimney in Appleton (Outagamie co.), was blown down by strong winds causing damage to a car, power lines and a neighboring house.Half dollar size hail fell at Menasha and there were several reports of dime to quarter size hail.Flooding caused damage to as many as 150 homes and 30 vehicles in Menasha (Winnebago co.) and the Town of Harrison (Calumet co.).

The worst hit area was from the Tooele Valley east through Salt Lake and Davis Counties, and east into the Wasatch Mountains. Freeways and side streets alike were snow packed and slick, resulting in nearly 1500 accidents statewide. Amazingly, no fatalities were reported from the accidents and injuries were minor. The heavy wet snow knocked out power to at least 70,000 people, mainly in Salt Lake and Davis Counties, as tree limbs fell on power lines. Almost 10,000 people went without pour for 48 hours or more, causing emergency shelters to be opened in Salt Lake City and Ogden. The threat of avalanches closed Little Cottonwood Canyon and placed Snowbird and Alta on inter-lodge restrictions. An empty light rail train derailed near the University of Utah, with dozens of airline flights being delayed or cancelled at the Salt Lake City International Airport, though one runway was kept open throughout the storm. The 10.6 inches of snow that fell at the Salt Lake Airport on the 26th smashed the record snowfall for the date of 4.3 inches set in 1936, and was the second snowiest December day on record. Some of the impressive snow totals included, Snowbird 65 inches, Alta 64 inches, Farmington Canyon 63 inches, Spruces 53 inches, Solitude 47 inches, Snowbasin 45 inches, The Canyons 40 inches and Brian Head 30 inches. And in the lower elevations, Upper Millcreek had an amazing 40 inches, East Layton 32 inches, Bountiful 30 inches, Centerville 28 inches, Kimball Junction 26 inches, South Ogden 24 inches, Tooele 23 inches, Salt Lake City Airport 19 inches, Spanish Fork 15 inches, Logan 14 inches, Brigham City 13 inches and Alpine, Fillmore and Morgan with 10 inches.

The strongest winds occurred during two time periods: in the morning shortly after the low pressure system's cold frontal passage and during the afternoon. The peak wind gusts of the event mainly occurred during the afternoon. Numerous trees, tree limbs, transformers and wires were knocked down and damaged homes and vehicles. Scattered transformer fires occurred. In some instances poles were snapped. Numerous roads were closed including Interstate 295 and Delaware State Route 10. The afternoon and evening commute was difficult because of many closed roads. Emergency personnel had the added problem with road closures because the high winds were blowing away the plastic and wood road barriers.  Shingles, chimney covers,  gutters and siding were ripped from houses and fences were damaged by downed limbs and trees.  Vehicles were damaged by fallen trees and/or flying debris. Awnings were torn away, store windows damaged, roadway business signs were knocked down as were overhead traffic signs and traffic signals. Trash and recycling cans were tossed in the middle of roads. Some schools had early dismissal because of the lost power and many scholastic games were cancelled. The high winds made it very difficult to fight fires and led to blow out tides at times of low tide during the evening of the 13th and also on the 14th. Conectiv Energy reported about 46,600 of its customers lost power in its Delaware service area. All power was restored by 6 p.m. on the 15th.

It caused major traffic backups on Interstate 95, U.S. Route 13 and Delaware State Route 9. In Newport, a 200 foot tall oak tree penetrated into the first floor of a home. Its roots flipped their neighbor's shed into the air. A man had his middle finger severed and ring finger nearly severed after the wind smashed a door close on him. The blow out tides left an oil refinery near Delaware City without enough cooling water late on the 13th and the 14th. This subsequently damaged the crude refining unit and caused sporadic pollution releases. The blow out tides left cooling water supplies nine to twelve feet below normal. Some pumps shut down and production was cut back and damaged the crude unit where oil was first processed. The crude unit also developed a leak. On the morning of the 14th, the accumulative effect of two days of strong to high winds resulted in the evacuation of 5,000 people from three office buildings in downtown Wilmington. Bolts on the facade of The Bank One building loosened on the 7th, 8th and 9th floors. The facade was designed to shift with the wind, but apparently shifted more than normal. The bolts that anchor the facade to the inner structure loosened. Cracks in the drywall were seen on the interior of the building. The building was evacuated as was a second Bank One building and the New Castle County Courthouse which was across the street from the side of that facade. An eight block area including Walnut and 4th Streets were closed. After the building was inspected, it was reopened at 415 p.m. that afternoon.

The high winds were caused by the pressure difference between the low pressure system in the Saint Lawrence Valley and a high pressure system in the Central Plains. The low intensified from a 1004 millibar system over Lake Superior the morning of the 12th, to a 982 millibar low near Montreal the morning of the 13th to a 970 millibar low in the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River the morning of the 14th. Some strong wind gusts also occurred on the 14th and hampered power restoration work. Winds diminished for good during the evening of the 14th.",,"PDS"

Lupit passed 160 miles north of Pohnpei as a 55 mph tropical storm on the afternoon of the 21st, and was upgraded to a typhoon as it passed 115 miles north of Chuuk late in the day on the 22nd. Typhoon Lupit continued to slowly intensify as it moved west-southwest on the 23rd, reaching 110 mph as it passed 45 miles north of Woleai Atoll in Yap State early on the 24th, 115 mph as it passed 30 miles northeast of Fais in the predawn hours of the 25th, 120 mph as it passed 35 miles northeast of Ulithi late in the morning, and 130 mph late that afternoon as it passed 145 miles northeast of Yap.Pohnpei State:Just before attaining typhoon intensity, Lupit passed 75 miles north of Oroluk Atoll in far-western Pohnpei State around 0700 SST on the 22nd. The automated station at Oroluk reported a maximum sustained wind of 18 mph from the southwest with a peak gust of 38 mph that morning, but the highest winds came a day later in enhanced monsoon flow, reaching 28 mph gusting to 43 mph from the south early on the 23rd. In the 24 hours ending at 2100 SST on the 22nd, 6.28 inches of rain was recorded. No injuries or damage were reported from Oroluk. Chuuk State:At the Chuuk Weather Service Office, the highest wind gust observed was from the south at 40 mph on the 23rd at 0800 SST, and 6.37 inches of rain fell in the 24 hours ending at 1000 SST on the 23rd. But in the Hall Islands, about 70 miles north of Chuuk, sustained winds likely reached 60-70 mph on the afternoon and evening of the 22nd as Lupit passed only 45 miles to the north. The same is true for Ulul, 180 miles northwest of Chuuk, where 60-70 mph winds were likely as Lupit passed 45 miles to the north around 0300 SST on the 23rd. The automated station there recorded a minimum pressure of 975.3 mb at that time, and 7.68"" of rain was recorded in the 22 hours ending on the 23rd at 1000 SST.There were no deaths or major injuries in the Hall islands or Ulul, but an unspecified number of ""minor"" injuries was reported. Most banana trees and some palm trees were blown down, and salt water contamination severely damaged or destroyed 100% of the subsistence crops on the islands. Yap State: On its rampage through Yap State, Typhoon Lupit affected Fais and Ulithi most severely, while dealing significant but lesser blows to Woleai and its neighboring atolls, and affecting Yap least of all. As Lupit passed north of Woleai early on the 24th, peak wind gusts are estimated to have reached 60 to 70 mph. But as Lupit passed 30 miles northeast of Fais around 0500 SST on the 25th, it hit that island with wind gusts estimated at 115 to 125 mph, along with an estimated 10"" or more of rain. Later in the morning, as Lupit passed 35 miles northeast of Ulithi, the automated station there recorded a highest sustained wind of 48 mph from the south at 1000 SST, and a peak gust of 98 mph from the southwest an hour later. The lowest recorded pressure was 986.1 mb at 0900 SST, and 10.35"" of rain fell in the 24 hours ending at 1500 SST that afternoon. Finally, as Lupit passed well northeast of Yap that afternoon, west winds at the Yap Weather Service Office gusted to 58 mph at 1307 SST, while the highest sustained wind of 35 mph didn't occur until 1657 SST, when the lowest pressure of 995.1 mb was measured. Rainfall at Yap totalled 5.02"" in the 24 hours ending at 2200 SST that evening. Miraculously, there were no deaths or serious injuries reported anywhere in Yap State, only an unspecified number of ""minor"" injuries. Damage for individual islands or island groups is summarized below:Fais:  Since Fais is an elevated island, inundation was not a factor, but 14 to 18 foot surf caused severe beach erosion. Numerous buildings were heavily damaged, with many roofs blown off. All subsistence crops were destroyed, including bananas and breadfruit. The island water supply was severely contaminated by sea spray. Ulithi: Coastal inundation of 3 to 5 feet, along with 14 to 18 foot surf, resulted in severe beach erosion and contamination of the water supply. All cultivated crops were destroyed, and the salt-saturated soil will be unfit for growing crops for one to two years. Many buildings were damaged, and power lines and poles were blown down. Woleai, Ifalik, Eauripik, Lamotrek, Satawal and neighboring islands: Coastal inundation was 2 to 4 feet, causing severe beach erosion and destroying most cultivated crops, including all crops on Ifalik, and rendering salty soils unsuitable for cultivation for up to 2 years. The sea water also severely contaiminated the islands' water supplies. Many tree limbs and power lines were downed on Woleai, and Woleai's runway was covered with sea water, making it unusable for a week. Several buildings were damaged, with roofs blown off. Yap: Only moderate beach erosion was noted, mainly on northern and eastern exposures. In low-lying areas in the northern, northeastern and southern parts of Yap, sea spray destroyed all the cultivated crops. Along those same coastlines, some roads and sea walls were damaged.",,"PDS"

During this period, rainfall totals averaged 5 to 9 inches over Hidalgo County, with 6 inches over Willacy County. Cameron County received 6 to 12 inches of rain, with Bayview, reporting 12.74 inches, 12.05 inches falling at Port Isabel,  9.69 falling at Los Fresnos, and 7.87 inches at Brownsville. The heavy rains caused extensive flooding of urban areas.  Damage reports from Cameron county officials indicate, that approximately 467 homes were affected by flooding rains.  Another 175 homes and businesses in Hidalgo and Willacy counties were also affected.  The region had experienced heavy rainfall much of the previous week due to abundant tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.  The rainfall led to saturated soil moisture values and low flash flood guidance values.  From the 19th on, heavy rainfall was caused by a slow moving tropical wave in combination with a cold front and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.  The American Red Cross opened an emergency shelter in the San Benito area of Cameron County which housed 223 people, primarily from the Green Valley acres subdivision and from areas surrounding the City of Los Fresnos.  The Salvation Army provided over 3200 meals for individuals impacted by the flooding, while the Texas Baptist Men Association provided 2100 hot meals and over 1000 showers.","PDS"

Snow mixed with sleet or ice pellets occurred southeast of a line from Ashland to Greensburg to Kinsley to Larned.  Strong north winds of 30 to 45 MPH caused plenty of blowing and drifting snow, with every county in the CWA reporting less than a quarter mile visibility for several hours, with occasional white out conditions.  Snowfall amounts were banded, with the two highest reports both being 6 inches, from southern Gray county and central Stanton county.  A 30 to 40 mile wide band of snowfall amounts from 4 to 5 inches fell from just north of Scott City southwest through northern Kearny county to southwest of Johnson City in Stanton County.  Another swath of snow 35 to 45 miles wide, also with snow amounts from 4 to 5 inches, fell from near Meade to Cimarron through Dodge City and Greensburg to near Medicine Lodge.  One more band of 4 to 5 inch amounts fell from extreme northwest Hodgeman County to just northwest of Ness City to near Hays.  Many schools and other planned activities were cancelled due to the weather, especially the low visibilities.  Numerous traffic accidents were reported in Liberal, Dodge City, Pratt, and Medicine Lodge.  Two jack-knifed semi-trailers, on a portion of Kansas Highway 96 between Scott City and Leoti, caused the highway to be closed for an hour and a half.  Zero visibility conditions closed U.S. Highway west of Ulysses for about 3 hours Tuesday afternoon on the 10th.",,"PDS"

The strongest winds occurred during two time periods: in the morning shortly after the low pressure system's cold frontal passage and during the afternoon. The peak wind gusts of the event mainly occurred during the afternoon. Several people were injured by downed trees. A couple of buildings collapsed. Numerous trees, tree limbs, transformers and wires were knocked down and damaged homes and vehicles. Scattered transformer fires occurred. In some instances poles were snapped. Numerous roads were closed including some major roadways. The afternoon and evening commute was difficult because of many closed roads. Emergency personnel had the added problem with road closures because the high winds were blowing away the plastic and wood road barriers.  Shingles, chimney covers, gutters and siding were ripped from houses and fences were damaged by downed limbs and trees.  Vehicles were damaged by fallen trees and/or flying debris. Awnings were torn away, store windows damaged, roadway business signs were knocked down as were overhead traffic signs and traffic signals. Trash and recycling cans were tossed in the middle of roads. Cart shelters tumbled in shopping centers. Some schools had early dismissal because of the lost power and many scholastic games were cancelled. The high winds made it very difficult to fight fires. It also led to blow out tides at times of low tide during the evening of the 13th and 14th along coastal areas and tidal sections of the Delaware River and its tributaries.

A house in the Vienna section of Independence Township suffered gutter damage after a tree fell on it. In Morris County, two homes were damaged by fallen trees in Pequannock Township. About 20 percent of Boonton Township lost power. Cranes were needed to remove the large trees. In Hunterdon County, a tree fell on a bus in Clinton Township. No injuries occurred. Sections of New Jersey State Routes 12, 31 and U.S. Route 202 were closed. About 8,000 homes and businesses in the county lost power. In Somerset County, several injuries occurred. In Somerville, seven utility poles snapped at 430 p.m. on South Bridge Street and crushed a vehicle. The 56-year-old driver cut his head. Another uninjured driver was temporarily trapped by the downed wires. In Raritan Borough, pieces of a roof tore away and caused leg injuries to an onlooker. In Bernardsville Borough, a 21-year-old man suffered leg and back injuries after the wind knocked him off his ladder.

In Mercer County, a roof partially tore off a home in Trenton and a tree fell on a Princeton home. In Burlington County, a driver was uninjured in spite of a tree that landed on his vehicle in Medford Township. The hardest hit locations in the county were Cinnaminson and Willingboro Townships. In Camden County, school children were not injured when a tree fell on their bus when leaving Saint Jude's School in Gloucester Township. In Camden, a large building in the process of being converted to housing collapsed in pieces between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. EST.In Cherry Hill, the wind fanned a blaze at a warehouse.

The winter storm put a big dent in the holiday shopping on Saturday the 6th. Some stores never opened. Hospitals had a difficult time getting their employees to and from work. Libraries were closed. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies to help clear the roads for plowing. The plows had a hard time keeping back roads with northwestern exposure clear on the weekend (6th and 7th) as strong winds blew the snow back on the road.       A couple of fatal traffic accidents occurred in northern New Jersey. On the 5th, a 36-year-old man died in Millstone Township (Monmouth County) after he left the westbound lanes of Interstate 195 and struck a tree.

The heaviest precipitation fell during two sections of this storm. The first came during the first half of the day on the 5th as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean were lifted over the region. The second came during the morning of the 6th as the upper air system supporting the northeaster moved across the region.",,"PDS"

Snowfall amounts were banded, with the two highest reports both being 6 inches, from southern Gray county and central Stanton county.  A 30 to 40 mile wide band of snowfall amounts from 4 to 5 inches fell from just north of Scott City southwest through northern Kearny county to southwest of Johnson City in Stanton County.  Another swath of snow 35 to 45 miles wide, also with snow amounts from 4 to 5 inches, fell from near Meade to Cimarron through Dodge City and Greensburg to near Medicine Lodge.  One more band of 4 to 5 inch amounts fell from extreme northwest Hodgeman County to just northwest of Ness City to near Hays.  Many schools and other planned activities were cancelled due to the weather, especially the low visibilities.  Numerous traffic accidents were reported in Liberal, Dodge City, Pratt, and Medicine Lodge.  Two jack-knifed semi-trailers, on a portion of Kansas Highway 96 between Scott City and Leoti, caused the highway to be closed for an hour and a half.

The strongest winds occurred during two time periods: in the morning shortly after the low pressure system's cold frontal passage and during the afternoon. The peak wind gusts of the event mainly occurred during the afternoon. A Lehigh County man was killed by a fallen tree. A few other persons were injured by downed trees. A couple of buildings collapsed. Numerous trees, tree limbs, transformers and wires were knocked down and damaged homes and vehicles. Scattered transformer fires occurred. In some instances poles were snapped. Numerous roads were closed including some major roadways. The afternoon and evening commute was difficult because of many closed roads. Emergency personnel had the added problem with road closures because the high winds were blowing away the plastic and wood road barriers.  Shingles, chimney covers,  gutters and siding were ripped from houses and fences were damaged by downed limbs and trees.  Vehicles were damaged by fallen trees and/or flying debris. Awnings were torn away, store windows damaged, roadway business signs were knocked down as were overhead traffic signs and traffic signals. Trash and recycling cans were tossed in the middle of roads. Some schools had early dismissal because of the lost power and many scholastic games were cancelled. The high winds made it very difficult to fight fires. It also led to blow out tides at times of low tide during the evening of the 13th and 14th along tidal sections of the Delaware River and its tributaries. Flights were either delayed or cancelled at Lehigh Valley International Airport. PECO Energy reported about 154,000 of its customers lost power in southeastern Pennsylvania. Metropolitan Edison reported about 110,000 of its Pennsylvania customers lost power and Pennsylvania Power and Light reported about 47,600 outages.

In South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania State Route 309 was closed for three hours. In Northampton County, in Easton, the high wind ripped away a six foot fiberglass slab from the Peace Candle in Center Square. A downed tree damaged the gutters and trellis of a home. Several homes in the College Hill section of the city were evacuated after a tree became unstable. Pennsylvania State Route 611 was closed and caused major traffic headaches in the city. In Bethlehem, a radio station lost power to its transmitter. In the Pennsville section of Lehigh Township the winds knocked down a wall of the Trading Post in the Indian Trail Park. The roof and another wall were taken down prior to the onset of the wind as part of a restoration project. The remaining walls had to be knocked down. The municipalities hit with the outages included Bangor Borough, Bethlehem, Easton and Wilson Borough. In Monroe County, Pennsylvania State Route 191 was closed. There were 20 emergency calls for downed trees in the county and about 22,000 homes and businesses lost power. In Berks County, in Laureldale Borough, a toppled four foot wide oak tree crushed a Sports Utility Vehicle. The mother walked away with just bumps on her head and a bruised leg. In Robeson Township, the wind tore a roof from a barn and partially tore a roof from another home. In Lower Alsace Township, a downed tree crushed the utility room roof of a house. The owner lost a truck to high winds the previous month. About 26,000 homes and businesses lost power. All power was restored by early on the 15th.

The roof was peeled from a Leverington Avenue house. In Bucks County, in Upper Southampton Township, a woman was injured when a tree crashed into an upstairs bedroom. In Lower Southampton Township, a pole and transformer crushed a mobile home. In Falls Township, a portion of the maintenance building roof was peeled away. In Warminster Township, downed trees and wires tore meters off an apartment complex and forced evacuation. Most of New Hope Borough lost power. In Telford Borough, a free standing cinder block wall at the rear of the Eckerd Drug Store collapsed. In Delaware County, homes were damaged by fallen trees in Collingdale, Secane and Marple. Springfield Township opened a shelter because of lost power. A downed tree damaged the township's radio tower and forced the police to operate on emergency power. Downed poles forced the closure of U.S. 202 and 1 in Chadds Ford.  In Montgomery County, all the downed trees and power lines forced Lower Pottsgrove Township to declare a state of emergency. A roof was blown from one building and debris closed a major roadway for the day. Other major roadway closures included U.S. Route 422 and Pennsylvania State Route 29. A downed tree struck a van on the Schuylkill Expressway near the Gladwyne Interchange. In Upper Moreland Township, a downed tree fell into a bedroom of one home. In Gilbertsville (Douglass Township), a large portion of a restaurant roof was blown away. The hardest hit municipalities with respect to power outages were North Wales and Plymouth Meeting. In Chester County, a wall under construction of a video store was knocked down in North Coventry Township. In West Fallowfield Township, a barn burned to the ground in the Cochranville area. It took firefighters three hours to put out the last vestiges of the fire as embers spread to a field. Grain, hay, three tractors and a truck were destroyed. A tree damaged a home in West Chester. The hardest hit municipality with respect to power outages were Coatesville and West Chester. Peak wind gusts included 60 mph in Glenside (Montgomery County), 59 mph in Downingtown (Chester County), 58 mph at the Philadelphia International Airport, 57 mph in Ontelaunee Township (Berks County), 54 mph in Pottstown (Montgomery County) and Reading (Berks County), 51 mph at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 49 mph in Doylestown (Bucks County), and 48 mph in Mount Pocono. The high winds were caused by the pressure difference between the low pressure system in the Saint Lawrence Valley and a high pressure system in the Central Plains. The low intensified from a 1004 millibar system over Lake Superior the morning of the 12th, to a 982 millibar low near Montreal the morning of the 13th to a 970 millibar low in the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River the morning of the 14th.

Snow spread from south to north across the region during the first half of the day on the 5th. It decreased in intensity from the late afternoon of the 5th into the predawn hours on the 6th. During this time, the snow mixed with some sleet in and around Philadelphia. Snow increased in intensity again during the morning and early afternoon on the 6th before it ended from southwest to northeast during the afternoon.  Accumulations averaged between 6 and 12 inches.  Ironically the heavy snow wreaked havoc with holiday parades, festivals and tree lightning ceremonies scheduled for the 5th and 6th. Many schools dismissed early. Many after school and weekend school activities were cancelled. High school football championship games as well as other sports activities were postponed. Even some college football games were postponed. Numerous accidents were reported. Drivers skidded helplessly into curbs, medians, ditches and other vehicles especially on overpasses and hills. Power outages were caused by drivers hitting poles. Ten minute commutes were taking one hour. So many accidents were reported around Philadelphia that a traffic reporter called it a $500 deductible day. Bus routes were either cancelled or rerouted. The college entrance SAT exams on the 6th were postponed. The winter storm put a big dent in the holiday shopping on Saturday the 6th. Some stores never opened. Hospitals had a difficult time getting their employees to and from work. Libraries were closed. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies to help clear the roads for plowing. On the 5th, about 10 percent of all flights leaving or arriving from Philadelphia International Airport were cancelled. The plows had a hard time keeping back roads with northwestern exposure clear on the weekend (6th and 7th) as strong winds blew the snow back on the road. Even sports utility vehicles were getting stuck in the drifts.      In Lehigh County, in Lower Macungie Township, two school children suffered minor injuries after a school bus skidded on ice while negotiating a curve. A state trooper was injured after his vehicle was struck while investigating another accident on U.S. 22 near Airport Road. In Berks County, four major roadways including U.S. Route 222 were closed. In Maxatawny Township, a teenager was critically injured and trapped in his vehicle for over one hour. In Upper Bern Township, a 78-year-old woman was critically injured after her vehicle collided with a jackknifed tractor trailer on westbound Interstate 78 on the 6th. The road was closed for two hours. In Chester County, seven people were hospitalized after a minivan crashed into a fuel truck on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Upper Uwchlan Township. There were 30 accidents on the Turnpike in Chester County.  In Bucks County, in Upper Makefield Township, a minivan on Pennsylvania State Route 532 struck a guardrail and hit a school bus. No one on the bus was injured, by the driver and the three-year-old in the minivan were. Emergency crews had difficulties reaching traffic accidents on Interstate 95.

Precipitation was falling as all snow throughout the state by daybreak on the 6th. Snow increased in intensity again during the morning and afternoon on the 6th before it ended from southwest to northeast during the late afternoon and early evening.  Accumulations averaged between 7 and 14 inches, with lighter accumulations in the southeast part of the state.  Ironically the heavy snow wreaked havoc with holiday parades, festivals and tree lightning ceremonies scheduled for the 5th and 6th. Even the Bruce Springsteen concert in Asbury Park (Monmouth County) was postponed from the 6th to the 7th.  Many schools dismissed early. Colleges in Morris County dismissed early. Many after school and weekend school activities were cancelled. High school football championship games as well as other sports activities were postponed. Some college football games were postponed. Hundreds of accidents were reported. In Middlesex County, there were 125 accidents alone in Edison and South Brunswick (Middlesex County). Forty-seven accidents occurred on Interstate 295 in Mercer and Burlington County. On the 5th, 160 accidents were reported on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. Speed restrictions were placed on those roadways. On the 6th dozens of additional accidents occurred on the Garden State Parkway between Ocean County and Cape May County.  Drivers skidded helplessly into curbs, medians, ditches and other vehicles especially on overpasses and hills. Power outages were caused by drivers hitting poles. Ten minute commutes were taking one hour. So many accidents were reported around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area that a traffic reporter called it a $500 deductible day.  On the 5th, bus routes ran up to 90 minutes late while rail lines reported delays of up to 30 minutes. Delays on the 6th were less. The college entrance SAT exams on the 6th were postponed. The winter storm put a big dent in the holiday shopping on Saturday the 6th. Some stores never opened. Hospitals had a difficult time getting their employees to and from work. Libraries were closed. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies to help clear the roads for plowing. The plows had a hard time keeping back roads with northwestern exposure clear on the weekend (6th and 7th) as strong winds blew the snow back on the road.       A couple of fatal traffic accidents occurred in northern New Jersey. On the 5th, a 36-year-old man died in Millstone Township (Monmouth County) after he left the westbound lanes of Interstate 195 and struck a tree. Motorists on 195 were stranded during the height of the storm on the 6th. In Somerset County, a 52-year-old man died on the 6th after he collided with a tractor trailer. In Morris County, two buses collided with each other on eastbound Interstate 80 near Parsippany. Four persons were injured. In a separate incident, a state trooper was injured while investigating an accident on Interstate 80. In Burlington County, a tractor trailer overturned on U.S. Route 130 in Willingboro and slid into a home. Another multi-vehicle accident closed the roadway in the same township. In Camden County, a serious multi-vehicle accident in Barrington shut down the northbound lanes of Interstate 295. In Ocean County, a 13-year-old boy suffered a serious head injury after sledding into a tree.

Snow spread from south to north across the region during the first half of the day on the 5th and did not reach Sussex County until the early afternoon of the 5th. Enough warm air moved into the southeast part of the state to change the snow to rain. Precipitation decreased in intensity from the late afternoon of the 5th into the predawn hours on the 6th. During this time, the snow mixed with some sleet and freezing rain in southwestern New Jersey. As the northeaster intensified off the New Jersey coast, it dragged colder air south and changed precipitation to sleet and freezing rain before dawn on the 6th in southeast New Jersey. Precipitation was falling as all snow throughout the state by daybreak on the 6th. Snow increased in intensity again during the morning and afternoon on the 6th before it ended from southwest to northeast during the late afternoon and early evening.  Accumulations averaged between 7 and 14 inches, with lighter accumulations in the southeast part of the state.  Ironically the heavy snow wreaked havoc with holiday parades, festivals and tree lightning ceremonies scheduled for the 5th and 6th. Even the Bruce Springsteen concert in Asbury Park (Monmouth County) was postponed from the 6th to the 7th.  Many schools dismissed early. Colleges in Morris County dismissed early. Many after school and weekend school activities were cancelled. High school football championship games as well as other sports activities were postponed. Some college football games were postponed. Hundreds of accidents were reported. In Middlesex County, there were 125 accidents alone in Edison and South Brunswick (Middlesex County). Forty-seven accidents occurred on Interstate 295 in Mercer and Burlington County. On the 5th, 160 accidents were reported on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. Speed restrictions were placed on those roadways. On the 6th dozens of additional accidents occurred on the Garden State Parkway between Ocean County and Cape May County.  Drivers skidded helplessly into curbs, medians, ditches and other vehicles especially on overpasses and hills. Power outages were caused by drivers hitting poles. Ten minute commutes were taking one hour. So many accidents were reported around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area that a traffic reporter called it a $500 deductible day.  On the 5th, bus routes ran up to 90 minutes late while rail lines reported delays of up to 30 minutes. Delays on the 6th were less. The college entrance SAT exams on the 6th were postponed. The winter storm put a big dent in the holiday shopping on Saturday the 6th. Some stores never opened. Hospitals had a difficult time getting their employees to and from work. Libraries were closed. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies to help clear the roads for plowing. The plows had a hard time keeping back roads with northwestern exposure clear on the weekend (6th and 7th) as strong winds blew the snow back on the road.       A couple of fatal traffic accidents occurred in northern New Jersey. On the 5th, a 36-year-old man died in Millstone Township (Monmouth County) after he left the westbound lanes of Interstate 195 and struck a tree. Motorists on 195 were stranded during the height of the storm on the 6th. In Somerset County, a 52-year-old man died on the 6th after he collided with a tractor trailer. In Morris County, two buses collided with each other on eastbound Interstate 80 near Parsippany. Four persons were injured. In a separate incident, a state trooper was injured while investigating an accident on Interstate 80. In Burlington County, a tractor trailer overturned on U.S. Route 130 in Willingboro and slid into a home. Another multi-vehicle accident closed the roadway in the same township. In Camden County, a serious multi-vehicle accident in Barrington shut down the northbound lanes of Interstate 295. In Ocean County, a 13-year-old boy suffered a serious head injury after sledding into a tree.

It moved northeast to near Cape Hatteras the morning of the 5th, was just east of the Virginia Capes the evening of the 5th, just east of Atlantic City the morning of the 6th and near Nantucket during the evening of the 6th. The heaviest precipitation fell during two sections of this storm. The first came during the first half of the day on the 5th as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean were lifted over the region. The second came during the morning of the 6th as the upper air system supporting the northeaster moved across the region.",,"PDS"

The precipitation started as rain but switched over to snow on the 10th from west to east. The much-needed precipitation was associated with low pressure moving east across southern Wisconsin.  An amateur radio operator near Delavan (Walworth Co.) had a two-day total of 2.49 inches.  Milwaukee Mitchell Field (Milwaukee Co.) gathered 1.46 inches and Madison Truax Field (Dane Co.) came in with 1.66 inches.  The drought conditions (at least D0 - abnormally dry) began on August 1, 2003.  However, parts of south-central and southeast Wisconsin would go on to finish 2003 several inches below normal for yearly precipitation.  Milwaukee only had 22.30 inches of precipitation in 2003 (normal is 34.81 inches) - the driest year since 1963 when only 19.10 inches was measured.

Snow spread from south to north across the region during the first half of the day on the 5th and did not reach Sussex County until the early afternoon of the 5th. Enough warm air moved into the southeast part of the state to change the snow to rain. Precipitation decreased in intensity from the late afternoon of the 5th into the predawn hours on the 6th. During this time, the snow mixed with some sleet and freezing rain in southwestern New Jersey. As the northeaster intensified off the New Jersey coast, it dragged colder air south and changed precipitation to sleet and freezing rain before dawn on the 6th in southeast New Jersey. Precipitation was falling as all snow throughout the state by daybreak on the 6th. Snow increased in intensity again during the morning and afternoon on the 6th before it ended from southwest to northeast during the late afternoon and early evening.  Accumulations averaged between 7 and 14 inches, with lighter accumulations in the southeast part of the state.  Ironically the heavy snow wreaked havoc with holiday parades, festivals and tree lightning ceremonies scheduled for the 5th and 6th. Even the Bruce Springsteen concert in Asbury Park (Monmouth County) was postponed from the 6th to the 7th.  Many schools dismissed early. Colleges in Morris County dismissed early. Many after school and weekend school activities were cancelled. High school football championship games as well as other sports activities were postponed. Some college football games were postponed. Hundreds of accidents were reported. In Middlesex County, there were 125 accidents alone in Edison and South Brunswick (Middlesex County). Forty-seven accidents occurred on Interstate 295 in Mercer and Burlington County. On the 5th, 160 accidents were reported on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. Speed restrictions were placed on those roadways. On the 6th dozens of additional accidents occurred on the Garden State Parkway between Ocean County and Cape May County.  Drivers skidded helplessly into curbs, medians, ditches and other vehicles especially on overpasses and hills. Power outages were caused by drivers hitting poles. Ten minute commutes were taking one hour. So many accidents were reported around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area that a traffic reporter called it a $500 deductible day.  On the 5th, bus routes ran up to 90 minutes late while rail lines reported delays of up to 30 minutes. Delays on the 6th were less. The college entrance SAT exams on the 6th were postponed. The winter storm put a big dent in the holiday shopping on Saturday the 6th. Some stores never opened. Hospitals had a difficult time getting their employees to and from work. Libraries were closed. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies to help clear the roads for plowing. The plows had a hard time keeping back roads with northwestern exposure clear on the weekend (6th and 7th) as strong winds blew the snow back on the road.       A couple of fatal traffic accidents occurred in northern New Jersey. On the 5th, a 36-year-old man died in Millstone Township (Monmouth County) after he left the westbound lanes of Interstate 195 and struck a tree. Motorists on 195 were stranded during the height of the storm on the 6th. In Somerset County, a 52-year-old man died on the 6th after he collided with a tractor trailer. In Morris County, two buses collided with each other on eastbound Interstate 80 near Parsippany. Four persons were injured. In a separate incident, a state trooper was injured while investigating an accident on Interstate 80. In Burlington County, a tractor trailer overturned on U.S. Route 130 in Willingboro and slid into a home. Another multi-vehicle accident closed the roadway in the same township. In Camden County, a serious multi-vehicle accident in Barrington shut down the northbound lanes of Interstate 295.

It moved northeast to near Cape Hatteras the morning of the 5th, was just east of the Virginia Capes the evening of the 5th, just east of Atlantic City the morning of the 6th and near Nantucket during the evening of the 6th. The heaviest precipitation fell during two sections of this storm.

Snow spread from south to north across the region during the first half of the day on the 5th and did not reach Sussex County until the early afternoon of the 5th. Enough warm air moved into the southeast part of the state to change the snow to rain. Precipitation decreased in intensity from the late afternoon of the 5th into the predawn hours on the 6th. During this time, the snow mixed with some sleet and freezing rain in southwestern New Jersey. As the northeaster intensified off the New Jersey coast, it dragged colder air south and changed precipitation to sleet and freezing rain before dawn on the 6th in southeast New Jersey. Precipitation was falling as all snow throughout the state by daybreak on the 6th. Snow increased in intensity again during the morning and afternoon on the 6th before it ended from southwest to northeast during the late afternoon and early evening.  Accumulations averaged between 7 and 14 inches, with lighter accumulations in the southeast part of the state.  Ironically the heavy snow wreaked havoc with holiday parades, festivals and tree lightning ceremonies scheduled for the 5th and 6th. Even the Bruce Springsteen concert in Asbury Park (Monmouth County) was postponed from the 6th to the 7th.  Many schools dismissed early. Colleges in Morris County dismissed early. Many after school and weekend school activities were cancelled. High school football championship games as well as other sports activities were postponed. Some college football games were postponed. Hundreds of accidents were reported. In Middlesex County, there were 125 accidents alone in Edison and South Brunswick (Middlesex County). Forty-seven accidents occurred on Interstate 295 in Mercer and Burlington County. On the 5th, 160 accidents were reported on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. Speed restrictions were placed on those roadways. On the 6th dozens of additional accidents occurred on the Garden State Parkway between Ocean County and Cape May County.  Drivers skidded helplessly into curbs, medians, ditches and other vehicles especially on overpasses and hills. Power outages were caused by drivers hitting poles. Ten minute commutes were taking one hour. So many accidents were reported around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area that a traffic reporter called it a $500 deductible day.  On the 5th, bus routes ran up to 90 minutes late while rail lines reported delays of up to 30 minutes. Delays on the 6th were less. The college entrance SAT exams on the 6th were postponed. The winter storm put a big dent in the holiday shopping on Saturday the 6th. Some stores never opened. Hospitals had a difficult time getting their employees to and from work. Libraries were closed. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies to help clear the roads for plowing. The plows had a hard time keeping back roads with northwestern exposure clear on the weekend (6th and 7th) as strong winds blew the snow back on the road.       A couple of fatal traffic accidents occurred in northern New Jersey. On the 5th, a 36-year-old man died in Millstone Township (Monmouth County) after he left the westbound lanes of Interstate 195 and struck a tree. Motorists on 195 were stranded during the height of the storm on the 6th. In Somerset County, a 52-year-old man died on the 6th after he collided with a tractor trailer. In Morris County, two buses collided with each other on eastbound Interstate 80 near Parsippany. Four persons were injured. In a separate incident, a state trooper was injured while investigating an accident on Interstate 80. In Burlington County, a tractor trailer overturned on U.S. Route 130 in Willingboro and slid into a home. Another multi-vehicle accident closed the roadway in the same township.

The plows had a hard time keeping back roads with northwestern exposure clear on the weekend (6th and 7th) as strong winds blew the snow back on the road.       A couple of fatal traffic accidents occurred in northern New Jersey. On the 5th, a 36-year-old man died in Millstone Township (Monmouth County) after he left the westbound lanes of Interstate 195 and struck a tree. Motorists on 195 were stranded during the height of the storm on the 6th. In Somerset County, a 52-year-old man died on the 6th after he collided with a tractor trailer. In Morris County, two buses collided with each other on eastbound Interstate 80 near Parsippany. Four persons were injured. In a separate incident, a state trooper was injured while investigating an accident on Interstate 80. In Burlington County, a tractor trailer overturned on U.S. Route 130 in Willingboro and slid into a home. Another multi-vehicle accident closed the roadway in the same township. In Camden County, a serious multi-vehicle accident in Barrington shut down the northbound lanes of Interstate 295. In Ocean County, a 13-year-old boy suffered a serious head injury after sledding into a tree.   Specific accumulations included 15.8 inches in Chatham (Morris County), 15.0 inches in Avenel (Middlesex County) and Clarksburg (Monmouth County), 14.5 inches in Hamilton Square (Mercer County) and Metuchen (Middlesex County), 14.0 inches in Delaware Township (Hunterdon County), 13.6 inches in Marcella (Morris County), 13.5 inches in New Egypt (Ocean County), 12.8 inches in Cream Ridge (Monmouth County), 12.5 inches in New Brunswick (Middlesex County), 12.3 inches in Morristown (Morris County), 12.2 inches in Belle Mead (Somerset County), 12.0 inches in West Amwell and Clinton (Hunterdon County), Stewartsville (Warren County), Sparta (Sussex County) and Somerville (Somerset County), 11.5 inches in Oakhurst (Monmouth County), 11.0 inches in Princeton (Mercer County), 10.0 inches in Wrightstown (Burlington County), Wantage (Sussex County) and Branchburg (Somerset County), 9.0 inches in Newton (Sussex County),  8.5 inches in Mount Laurel (Burlington County) and Hackettstown (Warren County), 7.1 inches in Estell Manor (Atlantic County), 7.0 inches in Hope (Warren County), 6.6 inches in Somerdale (Camden County), 6.5 inches in Glassboro (Gloucester County), 6.0 inches in Vorhees Township (Camden County), 5.7 inches in Hammonton (Atlantic County), 5.0 inches at the Atlantic City International Airport, Whiting (Ocean County) and Tabernacle (Burlington County), 4.0 inches in Newport (Cumberland County), 3.0 inches in Vineland (Cumberland County), 2.0 inches in Absecon (Atlantic County) and Toms River (Ocean County), 1.5 inches in Woodbine (Cape May County) and 0.5 inches in Cape May Harbor (Cape May County).The Northeaster was over the Gulf Coast States the morning of the 4th. It moved northeast to near Cape Hatteras the morning of the 5th, was just east of the Virginia Capes the evening of the 5th, just east of Atlantic City the morning of the 6th and near Nantucket during the evening of the 6th. The heaviest precipitation fell during two sections of this storm. The first came during the first half of the day on the 5th as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean were lifted over the region. The second came during the morning of the 6th as the upper air system supporting the northeaster moved across the region.",,"PDS"

Snow spread from south to north across the region during the first half of the day on the 5th and did not reach Sussex County until the early afternoon of the 5th. Enough warm air moved into the southeast part of the state to change the snow to rain. Precipitation decreased in intensity from the late afternoon of the 5th into the predawn hours on the 6th. During this time, the snow mixed with some sleet and freezing rain in southwestern New Jersey. As the northeaster intensified off the New Jersey coast, it dragged colder air south and changed precipitation to sleet and freezing rain before dawn on the 6th in southeast New Jersey. Precipitation was falling as all snow throughout the state by daybreak on the 6th. Snow increased in intensity again during the morning and afternoon on the 6th before it ended from southwest to northeast during the late afternoon and early evening.

During this period, rainfall totals averaged 5 to 9 inches over Hidalgo County, with 6 inches over Willacy County. Cameron County received 6 to 12 inches of rain, with Bayview, reporting 12.74 inches, 12.05 inches falling at Port Isabel,  9.69 falling at Los Fresnos, and 7.87 inches at Brownsville. The heavy rains caused extensive flooding of urban areas.  Damage reports from Cameron county officials indicate, that approximately 467 homes were affected by flooding rains.  Another 175 homes and businesses in Hidalgo and Willacy counties were also affected.  The region had experienced heavy rainfall much of the previous week due to abundant tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.  The rainfall led to saturated soil moisture values and low flash flood guidance values.  From the 19th on, heavy rainfall was caused by a slow moving tropical wave in combination with a cold front and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.  The American Red Cross opened an emergency shelter in the San Benito area of Cameron County which housed 223 people, primarily from the Green Valley acres subdivision and from areas surrounding the City of Los Fresnos.  The Salvation Army provided over 3200 meals for individuals impacted by the flooding, while the Texas Baptist Men Association provided 2100 hot meals and over 1000 showers.","PDS"

While precipitation changed to plain rain during the afternoon in southeastern Pennsylvania, the cold air could not be scoured from Berks County, the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos. This caused up to half an inch of ice to accrue. Hazardous driving conditions and scattered power outages resulted. Precipitation began as snow across the region during the early morning. As warmer air moved in aloft from the southeast and south, the snow changed to freezing rain and sleet in Philadelphia around 10 a.m. EST. This change spread north to Berks County by Noon EST, the Lehigh Valley by 2 p.m. EST and the Poconos by 3 p.m. EST. The change to plain rain occurred in Philadelphia around Noon EST, Doylestown (Bucks County) at 130 p.m. EST and Pottstown (Montgomery County) at 230 p.m. EST. It took until 10 p.m. EST for the change to plain rain to occur in Reading (Berks County).Temperatures remained below freezing farther north and precipitation never changed from freezing rain to plain rain. Snow accumulations were 1 to 4 inches, with up to 8 inches reported in the Poconos.

A few flights were cancelled. About 3,000 homes and businesses lost power as the ice took down some trees and poles. In Berks County, in South Heidelberg Township, about 1,000 homes and businesses lost power when a tree fell onto a power line. In Longswamp Township, several hundred people lost power on the 15th after three trees collapsed from the weight of the ice. In Northampton County, a pole collapsed onto an Easton House.

Snowfall amounts were banded, with the two highest reports both being 6 inches, from southern Gray county and central Stanton county.  A 30 to 40 mile wide band of snowfall amounts from 4 to 5 inches fell from just north of Scott City southwest through northern Kearny county to southwest of Johnson City in Stanton County.  Another swath of snow 35 to 45 miles wide, also with snow amounts from 4 to 5 inches, fell from near Meade to Cimarron through Dodge City and Greensburg to near Medicine Lodge.  One more band of 4 to 5 inch amounts fell from extreme northwest Hodgeman County to just northwest of Ness City to near Hays.  Many schools and other planned activities were cancelled due to the weather, especially the low visibilities.  Numerous traffic accidents were reported in Liberal, Dodge City, Pratt, and Medicine Lodge.

Freeways and side streets alike were snow packed and slick, resulting in nearly 1500 accidents statewide. Amazingly, no fatalities were reported from the accidents and injuries were minor. The heavy wet snow knocked out power to at least 70,000 people, mainly in Salt Lake and Davis Counties, as tree limbs fell on power lines. Almost 10,000 people went without pour for 48 hours or more, causing emergency shelters to be opened in Salt Lake City and Ogden. The threat of avalanches closed Little Cottonwood Canyon and placed Snowbird and Alta on inter-lodge restrictions. An empty light rail train derailed near the University of Utah, with dozens of airline flights being delayed or cancelled at the Salt Lake City International Airport, though one runway was kept open throughout the storm. The 10.6 inches of snow that fell at the Salt Lake Airport on the 26th smashed the record snowfall for the date of 4.3 inches set in 1936, and was the second snowiest December day on record. Some of the impressive snow totals included, Snowbird 65 inches, Alta 64 inches, Farmington Canyon 63 inches, Spruces 53 inches, Solitude 47 inches, Snowbasin 45 inches, The Canyons 40 inches and Brian Head 30 inches.

During the high wind event, about 15,000 people were without power and at least 4 radio stations (WXLP, KBEA, KBOB, and KORB) were known to be off the air.  In Bettendorf, Iowa, part of the wall at Bowe Manufacturing collapsed around 1500 CST.  Fortunately the building was evacuated and police closed down U.S. 67 before the failure occurred.  Many observing sites recorded peak wind gusts in the 52 to 56 mph range (45 to 49 knots) with sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph (26 to 35 knots).  Maximum measured winds were 53 knots (61 mph) by KWQC TV in Davenport, Iowa and 54 knots (62 mph) in Pearl City, Illinois.  At Lock and Dam 11 in Dubuque, Iowa, wind equipment there carried a sustained wind of 49 knots (56 mph) at 1630 CST for about 5 to 10 minutes.

The strongest winds occurred during two time periods: in the morning shortly after the low pressure system's cold frontal passage and during the afternoon. The peak wind gusts of the event mainly occurred during the afternoon. Several people were injured by downed trees. A couple of buildings collapsed. Numerous trees, tree limbs, transformers and wires were knocked down and damaged homes and vehicles. Scattered transformer fires occurred. In some instances poles were snapped. Numerous roads were closed including some major roadways. The afternoon and evening commute was difficult because of many closed roads. Emergency personnel had the added problem with road closures because the high winds were blowing away the plastic and wood road barriers.  Shingles, chimney covers, gutters and siding were ripped from houses and fences were damaged by downed limbs and trees.  Vehicles were damaged by fallen trees and/or flying debris. Awnings were torn away, store windows damaged, roadway business signs were knocked down as were overhead traffic signs and traffic signals. Trash and recycling cans were tossed in the middle of roads. Cart shelters tumbled in shopping centers. Some schools had early dismissal because of the lost power and many scholastic games were cancelled. The high winds made it very difficult to fight fires. It also led to blow out tides at times of low tide during the evening of the 13th and 14th along coastal areas and tidal sections of the Delaware River and its tributaries. Sections of many major roads were closed including the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Routes 202, 206 and 46 and New Jersey State Route 12.

Sections of New Jersey State Routes 12, 31 and U.S. Route 202 were closed. About 8,000 homes and businesses in the county lost power. In Somerset County, several injuries occurred. In Somerville, seven utility poles snapped at 430 p.m. on South Bridge Street and crushed a vehicle. The 56-year-old driver cut his head. Another uninjured driver was temporarily trapped by the downed wires. In Raritan Borough, pieces of a roof tore away and caused leg injuries to an onlooker. In Bernardsville Borough, a 21-year-old man suffered leg and back injuries after the wind knocked him off his ladder.

In Mercer County, a roof partially tore off a home in Trenton and a tree fell on a Princeton home. In Burlington County, a driver was uninjured in spite of a tree that landed on his vehicle in Medford Township. The hardest hit locations in the county were Cinnaminson and Willingboro Townships. In Camden County, school children were not injured when a tree fell on their bus when leaving Saint Jude's School in Gloucester Township. In Camden, a large building in the process of being converted to housing collapsed in pieces between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. EST.In Cherry Hill, the wind fanned a blaze at a warehouse.

The strongest winds occurred during two time periods: in the morning shortly after the low pressure system's cold frontal passage and during the afternoon. The peak wind gusts of the event mainly occurred during the afternoon. Several people were injured by downed trees. A couple of buildings collapsed. Numerous trees, tree limbs, transformers and wires were knocked down and damaged homes and vehicles. Scattered transformer fires occurred. In some instances poles were snapped. Numerous roads were closed including some major roadways. The afternoon and evening commute was difficult because of many closed roads. Emergency personnel had the added problem with road closures because the high winds were blowing away the plastic and wood road barriers.  Shingles, chimney covers, gutters and siding were ripped from houses and fences were damaged by downed limbs and trees.  Vehicles were damaged by fallen trees and/or flying debris. Awnings were torn away, store windows damaged, roadway business signs were knocked down as were overhead traffic signs and traffic signals. Trash and recycling cans were tossed in the middle of roads. Cart shelters tumbled in shopping centers. Some schools had early dismissal because of the lost power and many scholastic games were cancelled. The high winds made it very difficult to fight fires. It also led to blow out tides at times of low tide during the evening of the 13th and 14th along coastal areas and tidal sections of the Delaware River and its tributaries. Sections of many major roads were closed including the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Routes 202, 206 and 46 and New Jersey State Route 12. About 150,000 homes and business lost power in the state: Public Service Electric and Gas reported about 62,200 outages,  Conectiv Energy  reported about 54,000 outages and Jersey Central Power and Light about 23,000 outages and 400 poles down. All power was restored by the 15th.

About 1,600 county residents lost power with major outages in Newton and near the Stokes State Forest. In Warren County, a 45-year-old man was injured when a tree fell on him near the Econo-Court Motel on U.S. Route 46. The route itself was closed in several locations because of downed trees.  A house in the Vienna section of Independence Township suffered gutter damage after a tree fell on it. In Morris County, two homes were damaged by fallen trees in Pequannock Township. About 20 percent of Boonton Township lost power. Cranes were needed to remove the large trees. In Hunterdon County, a tree fell on a bus in Clinton Township. No injuries occurred. Sections of New Jersey State Routes 12, 31 and U.S. Route 202 were closed. About 8,000 homes and businesses in the county lost power. In Somerset County, several injuries occurred. In Somerville, seven utility poles snapped at 430 p.m. on South Bridge Street and crushed a vehicle. The 56-year-old driver cut his head. Another uninjured driver was temporarily trapped by the downed wires. In Raritan Borough, pieces of a roof tore away and caused leg injuries to an onlooker. In Bernardsville Borough, a 21-year-old man suffered leg and back injuries after the wind knocked him off his ladder. In the Basking Ridge section of Bernards Township, a postal worker was hit in the head by a tree limb. A tree fell through a house in Bernardsville.

A similar effect caused by Barnegat Bay occurred in Ocean County. About 9,000 homes and businesses lost power in Ocean and Monmouth Counties. Elsewhere in Ocean County, the southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway were backed up because of downed trees. Power outages were concentrated in the Holiday City section of Berkeley Township. In Mercer County, a roof partially tore off a home in Trenton and a tree fell on a Princeton home. In Burlington County, a driver was uninjured in spite of a tree that landed on his vehicle in Medford Township. The hardest hit locations in the county were Cinnaminson and Willingboro Townships. In Camden County, school children were not injured when a tree fell on their bus when leaving Saint Jude's School in Gloucester Township. In Camden, a large building in the process of being converted to housing collapsed in pieces between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. EST.In Cherry Hill, the wind fanned a blaze at a warehouse. The wind carried embers to the Woodcrest Development. Oversized insulation panels caught fire apparently by a acetylene torch. In Gloucester County, an addition to a home in Woolwich Township collapsed. In Atlantic County, the Atlantic City Police and Fire Communication Center lost power for an hour. Nearly all of Absecon lost power. In Cape May County, a 28 foot empty boxcar overturned on the northbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway in Upper Township. The Cape May Lewes Ferry suspended service for the rest of the day on the 13th. The high wind damaged the roofs of the Sea Isle City Bar and Hotel and the Lollipop Motel in North Wildwood.

The heavy rain was caused by an intense low pressure system at both the surface and aloft that developed over the Southern Plains on the 9th. The primary low pressure system moved toward the Great Lakes on the morning of the 10th while a secondary low pressure system was forming near the upper air support over the Tennessee Valley. This secondary low pressure system continued to intensify and was located over North Carolina the evening of the 10th, near Philadelphia around 7 a.m. EST on the 11th and in western Connecticut early in the evening on the 11th. This secondary low pressure system helped wring the moisture in the atmosphere from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean onto the region.",,"PDS"

Snowfall amounts were banded, with the two highest reports both being 6 inches, from southern Gray county and central Stanton county.  A 30 to 40 mile wide band of snowfall amounts from 4 to 5 inches fell from just north of Scott City southwest through northern Kearny county to southwest of Johnson City in Stanton County.  Another swath of snow 35 to 45 miles wide, also with snow amounts from 4 to 5 inches, fell from near Meade to Cimarron through Dodge City and Greensburg to near Medicine Lodge.  One more band of 4 to 5 inch amounts fell from extreme northwest Hodgeman County to just northwest of Ness City to near Hays.
