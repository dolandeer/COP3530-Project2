Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

A weak low pressure system developed over the northern Gulf of Mexico, then moved northeast into Alabama. This system threw moisture northward into unseasonably cold air over the Lower Ohio Valley, resulting in widespread snow. Specific snowfall amounts included 5 inches at Morganfield (Union County), 5 inches about five miles south of Owensboro (Daviess County), 4 inches at Kevil (Ballard County), 3 inches at Paducah (McCracken County), 3 inches at Marion (Crittenden County), 3 inches at Hanson (Hopkins County), 2.5 inches at Eddyville (Lyon County), 2 inches at Dublin (Graves County), and one inch at Hickman (Fulton County).

The heaviest snowfall amounts were in counties along the Ohio River, which received anywhere from three to five inches. To the southeast of the Ohio River counties, anywhere from one to three inches fell along a corridor from Fulton and Mayfield to Princeton and Madisonville. Less than an inch was reported along the Tennessee border from Murray to Hopkinsville. The National Weather Service office at Paducah measured 2.8 inches, which was the heaviest snowfall for so early in the season. A weak low pressure system developed over the northern Gulf of Mexico, then moved northeast into Alabama. This system threw moisture northward into unseasonably cold air over the Lower Ohio Valley, resulting in widespread snow. Specific snowfall amounts included 5 inches at Morganfield (Union County), 5 inches about five miles south of Owensboro (Daviess County), 4 inches at Kevil (Ballard County), 3 inches at Paducah (McCracken County), 3 inches at Marion (Crittenden County), 3 inches at Hanson (Hopkins County), 2.5 inches at Eddyville (Lyon County), 2 inches at Dublin (Graves County), and one inch at Hickman (Fulton County).

In addition, heavy rainfall became a problem, resulting in some flash flooding.","","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

Less than an inch was reported along the Tennessee border from Murray to Hopkinsville. The National Weather Service office at Paducah measured 2.8 inches, which was the heaviest snowfall for so early in the season. A weak low pressure system developed over the northern Gulf of Mexico, then moved northeast into Alabama. This system threw moisture northward into unseasonably cold air over the Lower Ohio Valley, resulting in widespread snow. Specific snowfall amounts included 5 inches at Morganfield (Union County), 5 inches about five miles south of Owensboro (Daviess County), 4 inches at Kevil (Ballard County), 3 inches at Paducah (McCracken County), 3 inches at Marion (Crittenden County), 3 inches at Hanson (Hopkins County), 2.5 inches at Eddyville (Lyon County), 2 inches at Dublin (Graves County), and one inch at Hickman (Fulton County).

A cold front in association with the upper level trough was rapidly moving eastward through Western Oklahoma and Texas. Overnight across Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana, moderate instability was in place with increasing low and mid-level shear as the upper trough approached from the west. Storms eventually erupted ahead of the cold front across Central Oklahoma and Northern Texas, maturing into a squall line as it approached the region during the predawn hours of Monday, Oct. 13th. As the squall line traversed through the region, widespread wind damage was reported associated with straight line winds. Several short track, intense tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the squall line as well across portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas and Northern Louisiana. The storms finally exited the region during the afternoon hours of Oct. 13th.

No injuries were reported as a result of the severe weather and flooding, but the far northern part of the state received much damage on account of the winds and flooding.","Light rain behind a departing thunderstorm complex allowed strong low level winds to reach the surface near Prairie Village.

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

Storms eventually erupted ahead of the cold front across Central Oklahoma and Northern Texas, maturing into a squall line as it approached the region during the predawn hours of Monday, Oct. 13th. As the squall line traversed through the region, widespread wind damage was reported associated with straight line winds. Several short track, intense tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the squall line as well across portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas and Northern Louisiana. The storms finally exited the region during the afternoon hours of Oct. 13th. Post-event Storm Surveys determined that 6 tornadoes occurred with this severe weather outbreak, one of which produced 1 fatality and 4 injuries in Little River County, Arkansas. Another tornado produced widespread damage across Ouachita Parish in Monroe, Louisiana.","An National Weather Service Storm Survey team determined that a brief and weak EF-0 tornado touched down south of CR 108 where it snapped a number of trees and destroyed a barn.","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

This large boundary extended along the Interstate 20 corridor of North Central and East Texas into North Louisiana, with strong daytime heating atop a very moist air mass contributing to moderate instability, resulting in shower and thunderstorm development. These storms produced numerous outflow boundaries across North Louisiana, which allowed for these storms to become more widespread and form a small mesoscale convective system, as they accelerated south across North Central Louisiana. Damaging winds were noted at times, resulting in downed trees and power lines over the area. A second cluster of showers and thunderstorms developed over East Central Texas south of the stationary outflow boundary, and quickly spread east southeast across East Texas south of Interstate 20.

A cold front in association with the upper level trough was rapidly moving eastward through Western Oklahoma and Texas.  Overnight across Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana, moderate instability was in place with increasing low and mid-level shear as the upper trough approached from the west. Storms eventually erupted ahead of the cold front across Central Oklahoma and Northern Texas, maturing into a squall line as it approached the region during the predawn hours of Monday, Oct. 13th.  As the squall line traversed through the region, widespread wind damage was reported associated with straight line winds.  Several short track, intense tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the squall line as well across portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas and Northern Louisiana.  The storms finally exited the region during the afternoon hours of Oct. 13th.

The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. For the first time on record, red flag warnings were issued in January for not only the Southern Sierra Nevada and the Tehachapi Mountains but also the south end of the San Joaquin Valley.","","CSV"

The 2013-2014 water year (July 1 - June 30) concluded with Fresno setting its second driest on record (4.81 inches) and Bakersfield setting its third driest (2.41 inches). ||There continues to be significant media coverage on the on-going drought conditions. These reports include discussion of significant re-allocation of water resources from the east to west side of the San Joaquin Valley, farmers forgoing planting of some crops, a decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Southern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, loss or reduction of ground water, and an unprecedented increase in fire danger across the Southern Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains. For the first time on record, red flag warnings were issued in January for not only the Southern Sierra Nevada and the Tehachapi Mountains but also the south end of the San Joaquin Valley.","","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

At the surface, a warm front  was rapidly moving northward across East Texas and North Louisiana with low level moisture returning quickly in the wake of the northward moving warm front.  A cold front in association with the upper level trough was rapidly moving eastward through Western Oklahoma and Texas.  Overnight across Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana, moderate instability was in place with increasing low and mid-level shear as the upper trough approached from the west. Storms eventually erupted ahead of the cold front across Central Oklahoma and Northern Texas, maturing into a squall line as it approached the region during the predawn hours of Monday, Oct. 13th.  As the squall line traversed through the region, widespread wind damage was reported associated with straight line winds.  Several short track, intense tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the squall line as well across portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas and Northern Louisiana.  The storms finally exited the region during the afternoon hours of Oct. 13th.

Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

Peak wind gusts included 50 mph in Wantage (Sussex County), Tuckerton (Ocean County) and West Cape May (Cape May County), 48 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), 47 mph in Barnegat (Ocean County), 46 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 43 mph in Lumberton (Burlington County), 41 mph in Millville (Cumberland County) and 40 mph in Trenton (Mercer County).  A developing low pressure over the Carolinas moved offshore on the morning of November 1st. As it passed east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina during the early evening of November 1st, the pressure gradient (difference) between it and a high pressure system in the Mississippi Valley started to increase and winds became stronger. This pressure difference over New Jersey maximized during the morning of the 2nd. At 7 a.m. EST on November 2nd, the low pressure system was well east of the New Jersey coast and as it reached the coastal waters east of Massachusetts that afternoon, strong winds ceased across the state.","","CSV"

At the surface, a warm front  was rapidly moving northward across East Texas and North Louisiana with low level moisture returning quickly in the wake of the northward moving warm front.  A cold front in association with the upper level trough was rapidly moving eastward through Western Oklahoma and Texas.  Overnight across Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana, moderate instability was in place with increasing low and mid-level shear as the upper trough approached from the west. Storms eventually erupted ahead of the cold front across Central Oklahoma and Northern Texas, maturing into a squall line as it approached the region during the predawn hours of Monday, Oct. 13th.  As the squall line traversed through the region, widespread wind damage was reported associated with straight line winds.  Several short track, intense tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the squall line as well across portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas and Northern Louisiana.  The storms finally exited the region during the afternoon hours of Oct. 13th.  Post-event Storm Surveys determined that 6 tornadoes occurred with this severe weather outbreak, one of which produced 1 fatality and 4 injuries in Little River County, Arkansas.

The ridge broke down on the 1st of August and was overrun by two weak midlevel impulses on August 2nd.  As the second impulse passed over Central Washington during the late afternoon, strong to severe storms developed over the Waterville Plateau producing a combination of heavy rain and moderate size hail.  Meanwhile, dewpoint depressions over Eastern Washington had grown between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  The rain and hail cooled outflow winds from storms over the Waterville Plateau spread east and gained momentum while tracking along the Highway 2 corridor across the Upper Columbia Basin.  Additional storms fired along the gust front and continued to reinforce the cold pool and resultant winds.  Gusty winds and blowing dust which originated over the Waterville Plateau traveled across Banks Lake and through much of Lincoln County but generally remained below severe speeds.  It wasn't until the outflow boundary moved into Eastern Lincoln County and Lake Roosevelt near Seven Bays Marina when wind speeds ranged between 60 and 70 miles per hour.  The winds led to numerous downed trees, waves four to six feet on Lake Roosevelt, widespread boat damage, power outages, and structural damage.  The winds also fanned new wildfire starts from lightning.  As the afternoon progressed, a combination of forcing from the shortwave and gust front continued to fuel additional storms over Northeastern Washington.   Outflow winds from these storms generally moved north to south.  As the north to south boundaries interacted with the westerly boundaries, some locations were spared experiencing wind gusts between 35 and 45 mph.  In this absence, winds of 50 to 70 mph were observed coupled with widespread tree damage.  A few storms briefly produced quarter size hail between Davenport and Northwest Spokane.","The Midnight Mine RAWS measured a wind gust of 68 mph.  Numerous boats were damaged on Lake Roosevelt due to the winds.  Boaters and videos indicated wind waves of four to six feet on the Lake.  At least ten boats were severely damaged, two boats capsized, and numerous other boats received minor damage.  Several docks were damaged.  No injuries were reported.  Numerous trees were downed across southern Stevens County.","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

At the surface, a warm front was rapidly moving northward across East Texas and North Louisiana with low level moisture returning quickly in the wake of the northward moving warm front. A cold front in association with the upper level trough was rapidly moving eastward through Western Oklahoma and Texas. Overnight across Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana, moderate instability was in place with increasing low and mid-level shear as the upper trough approached from the west. Storms eventually erupted ahead of the cold front across Central Oklahoma and Northern Texas, maturing into a squall line as it approached the region during the predawn hours of Monday, Oct. 13th. As the squall line traversed through the region, widespread wind damage was reported associated with straight line winds. Several short track, intense tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the squall line as well across portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas and Northern Louisiana. The storms finally exited the region during the afternoon hours of Oct. 13th. Post-event Storm Surveys determined that 6 tornadoes occurred with this severe weather outbreak, one of which produced 1 fatality and 4 injuries in Little River County, Arkansas.

At the surface, a warm front  was rapidly moving northward across East Texas and North Louisiana with low level moisture returning quickly in the wake of the northward moving warm front.  A cold front in association with the upper level trough was rapidly moving eastward through Western Oklahoma and Texas.  Overnight across Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana, moderate instability was in place with increasing low and mid-level shear as the upper trough approached from the west. Storms eventually erupted ahead of the cold front across Central Oklahoma and Northern Texas, maturing into a squall line as it approached the region during the predawn hours of Monday, Oct. 13th.  As the squall line traversed through the region, widespread wind damage was reported associated with straight line winds.  Several short track, intense tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the squall line as well across portions of Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas and Northern Louisiana.  The storms finally exited the region during the afternoon hours of Oct. 13th.

Due to excessively moist atmospheric conditions, a Flash Flood Watch was in effect from noon August 12th through 5 am on Wednesday August 13th. Many of the thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain with rainfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour at times. The heavy rain led to urban flooding, flash flooding, and eventually areal flooding which affected much of the greater Phoenix area, especially the southeast and south central portions.","Thunderstorms with locally heavy rain developed across the central portion of the greater Phoenix area during the afternoon and evening hours on August 12th; peak rain rates with the heavier showers approached 2 inches per hour at times. The heavy rain led to flood damage at some of the buildings in downtown Phoenix including the Boys & Girls Club of Metro Phoenix Administration Building located at 24th Street and Thomas Road. According to an on-line article posted at the AZFamily.Com website, heavy rain caused the roof of the building to cave in. A number of ceiling panels collapsed, leaving exposed ductwork and wiring. Standing water was left about six inches deep on the floor. Collapsed air-conditioning ductwork was hanging from the ceiling and appeared ready to fall to the ground at any second. Referring to the water damage, a Boys & Girls Club spokeswoman Lariana Forsythe said It's a disaster. Although damage to the building was considerable, nobody was hurt. Another on-line article reported that the Children's Museum of Phoenix was damaged after thousands of gallons of water poured into its atrium during the monsoon storms. The museum, located near Seventh and Van Buren Streets in downtown Phoenix, closed its first floor and three-story climbing structure due to the water damage.

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

Widespread heavy rain eased from the 6th through 8th, however, as more typical isolated to scattered thunderstorms dominated the landscape from the 9th through 12th.  A monsoon burst, aided by a subtropical low pressure system aloft, brought heavy rain and local flash flooding on the 13th and 14th. Drier air worked into the northwest parts of the state with much less storm activity from the 15th into the 21st. Another good surge of monsoon moisture from the south arrived late on the 21st with widespread showers and storms on the 22nd, some with heavy rain and flash flooding. The 23rd was much drier then a gradual increase in moisture returned on the 24th and continued into the 27th. The 26th was an active day with a few reports of significant flash flooding. The remainder of the month turned much drier and warmer.  Despite the active monsoon,  New Mexico's rangeland and pastures were rated 56% very poor to poor at the beginning of the month,  with  only modest improvements during the month. Despite short-term gains,  longer-term hydrological impacts (below-normal reservoir levels) remained after multiple years of below-normal snowpack. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District curtailed water bank deliveries for irrigation in response to low flows along the Rio Grande during the month. The combination of short- and long-term hydrological impacts, below-normal mountain snowpack conditions in the headwater regions led to the re-introduction of an area of Moderate Drought (D1) in the Middle Rio Grande corridor from Socorro County northward to Sante Fe County.","","CSV"

A couple of these storms became severe during the afternoon, with an EF-1 tornado touching down northeast of Mansfield in Desoto Parish. This tornado snapped numerous trees just east of Clear Lake, where it crossed over the International Paper Plant, peeling back portions of the metal walls and roof. One car was flipped over, and numerous car windows were blown out as well at the IP Plant, as it tracked east into western Red River Parish. Several other trees were snapped across mainly open pasture, before the tornado crossed over Highway 1 and lifted prior to reaching the Red River. This parent thunderstorm re-intensified as it shifted northeast into southern Bienville Parish, where a large swath of 60+ mph winds blew across the western and central portions of the parish. This resulted in numerous trees being downed across the parish before weakening shortly there afterwards.","Several trees were downed in the village of Jamestown, Louisiana.","CSV"
