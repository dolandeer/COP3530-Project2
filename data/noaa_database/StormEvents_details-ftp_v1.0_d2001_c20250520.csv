The strong wind produced considerable blowing and drifting snow, which created low visibilities in open and rural areas, and partially blocked roads.  Law enforcement officials reported at least eight deaths across the area in weather-related traffic accidents Friday night and early Saturday morning.  A law enforcement official attributed the numerous accidents to rapidly changing road conditions and motorists traveling too fast for conditions.  Law enforcement also handled numerous minor accidents and vehicles in ditches during the period.  Many area schools were closed Friday, or dismissed early.

Initially, temperatures were cool enough for the precipitation to fall as light snow.  Most of the state received from one to five inches of snow during the afternoon and evening of the 28th.  During the night, warm air moved in aloft.  As the next round of precipitation began, it fell in the form of freezing rain.  All of Iowa received significant ice from this.  Ice accretion rates were between 5 and 10 hundredths of an inch per hours.  The shallow cold air eroded over the southeast and central sections of the state by late morning, changing the freezing rain to rain.  This limited the accumulation of ice to under one quarter of an inch.  Over far north central into west central Iowa, temperatures at the surface failed to warm above freezing.  Freezing rain continued through the afternoon with several areas reporting one quarter to one half inch of ice accumulation on trees and power lines.  Damage was minor as there was little wind with this event.  Spotty power outages were reported and some tree limbs were downed.  Nearly all schools in the state and many businesses closed their doors in anticipation of the storm.  Travel was difficult through the morning and early afternoon hours.

Henderson County Illinois received amounts up to five inches.  As the system continued progressing to the east, a northwest wind increased during the late afternoon and evening, with gusts up to 30 miles an hour.  The strong wind produced considerable blowing and drifting snow, which created low visibilities in open and rural areas, and partially blocked roads.  Law enforcement officials reported at least eight deaths across eastern Iowa in weather-related traffic accidents Friday night and early Saturday morning.  Five of those fatalities occurred Friday evening in a two-vehicle accident in Washington County Iowa.  An Iowa State Trooper attributed the numerous accidents to rapidly changing road conditions and motorists traveling too fast for conditions.  Law enforcement also handled numerous minor accidents and vehicles in ditches during the period.  Many area schools were closed Friday, or dismissed early.  Hazardous driving conditions continued into the early morning hours of 1/27, before the winds relaxed.",,"PDS"

As the system continued progressing to the east, a northwest wind increased during the late afternoon and evening, with gusts up to 30 miles an hour.  The strong wind produced considerable blowing and drifting snow, which created low visibilities in open and rural areas, and partially blocked roads.  Law enforcement officials reported at least eight deaths across the area in weather-related traffic accidents Friday night and early Saturday morning.  A law enforcement official attributed the numerous accidents to rapidly changing road conditions and motorists traveling too fast for conditions.  Law enforcement also handled numerous minor accidents and vehicles in ditches during the period.  Many area schools were closed Friday, or dismissed early.  Hazardous driving conditions continued into the early morning hours of 1/27, before the winds relaxed.",,"PDS"

Henderson County Illinois received amounts up to five inches.  As the system continued progressing to the east, a northwest wind increased during the late afternoon and evening, with gusts up to 30 miles an hour.  The strong wind produced considerable blowing and drifting snow, which created low visibilities in open and rural areas, and partially blocked roads.  Law enforcement officials reported at least eight deaths across the area in weather-related traffic accidents Friday night and early Saturday morning.  A law enforcement official attributed the numerous accidents to rapidly changing road conditions and motorists traveling too fast for conditions.  Law enforcement also handled numerous minor accidents and vehicles in ditches during the period.  Many area schools were closed Friday, or dismissed early.

During the night, warm air moved in aloft.  As the next round of precipitation began, it fell in the form of freezing rain.  All of Iowa received significant ice from this.  Ice accretion rates were between 5 and 10 hundredths of an inch per hours.  The shallow cold air eroded over the southeast and central sections of the state by late morning, changing the freezing rain to rain.  This limited the accumulation of ice to under one quarter of an inch.  Over far north central into west central Iowa, temperatures at the surface failed to warm above freezing.  Freezing rain continued through the afternoon with several areas reporting one quarter to one half inch of ice accumulation on trees and power lines.  Damage was minor as there was little wind with this event.  Spotty power outages were reported and some tree limbs were downed.  Nearly all schools in the state and many businesses closed their doors in anticipation of the storm.  Travel was difficult through the morning and early afternoon hours.  There was some improvement with the daylight and treatment of the roads.  Freezing rain changed to snow during the evening hours, however accumulation of snow as generally under 3 inches.",,"PDS"

The low pulled abundant warm, moist air northward, which overrode colder air in place near the surface.  The biggest impact from the storm was the significant ice accumulations, and ice storm warnings were in effect for the area from Sunday afternoon through early Monday afternoon.  Snow and locally heavy rains with the storm also contributed to the hazardous road conditions and some flooding of urban streets and rural roads.  The precipitation began as snow and sleet, starting in far northeast Missouri, west central Illinois, and far southeast Iowa by mid-morning Sunday.  The snow and sleet then spread north through the afternoon, with  periods of moderate to heavy snow and accumulations around one to three inches over areas north of U.S. Highway 34.  The precipitation then changed over to freezing rain from south to north across the area from Sunday afternoon through evening.  Freezing rain continued south of Highway 34 through 8 am on Monday, and through early Monday afternoon along and north of Interstate 80.  Ice accumulations of 1/4 to 1/2 inch were common across much of eastern Iowa, far northeast Missouri, and western Illinois,  with amounts as high as one inch in Van Buren County Iowa and Hancock County Illinois.  Area law enforcement officials were kept very busy handling numerous accidents, beginning Sunday afternoon and continuing through Monday night.  Late Sunday afternoon, two people were killed and an Iowa State Trooper was seriously injured when a semi-trailer truck swerved off Interstate 80 in Cedar County Iowa and struck a squad car and another vehicle.  Around the same time in Davenport, Iowa, two motorists escaped with only minor injuries when their vehicle swerved over a ten foot wall.  Another accident in Moline, Illinois, earlier in the day caused a brief power outage for more than 800 Quad City residents.  A Freeport, Illinois hospital handled six slip-and-fall injuries on Monday.  Law enforcement also reported trees and power lines down due to the ice accumulation in Johnson County in Iowa, and Stephenson, Carroll, Hancock, and McDonough Counties in Illinois.  After the precipitation changed over to rain Monday morning and afternoon, locally heavy amounts of one to two inches fell across much of the area, before the rain tapered off from south to north by Monday night.  Law enforcement reported street flooding in Davenport and Burlington Iowa, and flooding of rural roads in Hancock County Illinois.  Above-freezing temperatures also produced some snowmelt during the day Monday, which further aggravated the flooding.  Falling temperatures late Monday afternoon and night caused the slush and ponded water on roads to re-freeze, which created very hazardous travel conditions, mainly on secondary and rural gravel roads.",,"PDS"

By the evening of the 10th a circulation was observed in Quick Scat data near 5N156E. Between 16Z and 21Z on the morning of the 11th an automated weather observing station on Nukuror(3.85N 155.01E) observed wind westerlywinds were consistently gusting near 40 kt with a peak gust of 42 kt at 1707Z. Thisindicated that the system was possibly strengthening and by the morning of the 12th it became Tropical Depression 31W 250 miles southeast of Chuuk. By the morning of the13th the depression became Tropical Storm Faxai when it was located 115 miles southeastof Pohnpei. A westerly wind burst along the equator pushed the tropical storm furthereastward and by the evening of the 13th Faxai was located near Kosrae(5.6N 163.0E). On the morning of the 16th the storm was about 30 miles west-southwest of Kosrae. With weak steering currents Faxai was nearly stationary for a few days in the vicinityof Kosrae. This resulted in heavy rainfall over the island. The 24 hour rainfall totalending at 0757Z on the 15th was 10.74 inches with 24.76 inches falling from 13/1957Z to18/2257Z. An automated wind sensor on Kosrae reported sustained winds of 36 mph twice onthe 19th. The 1st at 1257 and the second at 2257. Both winds were from the southwest. A peak wind of 64 mph was recorded on the 15th at 1857. Only one indirect death occurred onKosrae. Electrical power was knocked out on the island and because of the heavy rainfalla lot of flooding was reported. Because of the persistent southwest fetch caused by the storm the southern clockwise through western shore of Kosrae experienced some coastal inundation. Many rocks were thrown up on the road on that portion of the island. Damage was reported to the banana crops. By the 18th the storm had drifted west and was near Pingelap(6.2N 160.7E). An automatedanemometer recorded a maximum sustained wind of 29 mph of 0758 and 1158 on the 18th. A peakgust of 48 mph was recorded early on the morning of the 18th at 0058. The center of the tropicalstorm passed very close to Pingelap on the afternoon of the 18th. Strong winds on Pingelap downed many banana trees. Runup of sea water caused by the tropical storm caused damage tosome Taro patches.   The tropical storm continued on its slow northwest movement with the center passing 135 miles to thenorth of the island on morning of the 21st. Rainbands and a southwesterly monsoon flow createdlower pressure and stronger winds along the right periphery of the tropical storm. As a resultPohnpei received strong winds on the 20th with a peak wind of 34 mph at 1352. On the 20 the 24 hourrainfall total at the Pohnpei WSO was 3.13 inches. The heavy rain caused flooding and two landslidesin the Nett Municipality of Pohnpei.

The strong wind produced considerable blowing and drifting snow, which created low visibilities in open and rural areas, and partially blocked roads.  Law enforcement officials reported at least eight deaths across the area in weather-related traffic accidents Friday night and early Saturday morning.  A law enforcement official attributed the numerous accidents to rapidly changing road conditions and motorists traveling too fast for conditions.

Ice accretion rates were between 5 and 10 hundredths of an inch per hours.  The shallow cold air eroded over the southeast and central sections of the state by late morning, changing the freezing rain to rain.  This limited the accumulation of ice to under one quarter of an inch.  Over far north central into west central Iowa, temperatures at the surface failed to warm above freezing.  Freezing rain continued through the afternoon with several areas reporting one quarter to one half inch of ice accumulation on trees and power lines.

The weather made a turn for the worse on the evening of the 7th and early morning of the 8th as the first round of freezing precipitation began.  This event was not a major event, but did cause glazing over a good part of the state and resulted in many school closings.  Very warm and humid air streamed north ahead of the main system during the day on the 8th.  Surface dew point temperatures rose into the 60s across southeast Kansas into central Missouri.  In contrast to that, Arctic high pressure was poised to the north of Iowa.  A sharp frontal boundary extended from Kansas into southeast Iowa.  While the southeast corner of the state saw temperatures soar into the low 60s, northwest Iowa fell into the single digits.  Warm air aloft, with a layer of air as warm as 55 degrees F., was in place over  Iowa.  Rain began to fall during the afternoon of the 8th and continued through the night.  Thunderstorms accompanied the rain, increasing amounts of ice accumulation considerably.  Nearly all of the southeast two thirds of the state picked up one quarter to one half inch of ice accumulation.  There were numerous reports of fallen tree limbs and power outages.  Damage occurred due to falling limbs as well as freezing damage caused by power outages.  Fortunately, widespread power outages did not occur.  Road surfaces became completely ice covered over all of the state.  There were hundreds of reports of people falling on the ice, resulting in injury.  Nearly all activities in the state were called off for the 9th.  Travel became very hazardous.  Reports of accidents and jack-knifed trucks were far too numerous to mention.

As thunderstorms continued to move northeast into Iowa, the freezing rain that was falling began to transition over to frozen precipitation.  Initially freezing rain became mixed with and changed over to ice pellets as the cold air became deeper.  The transition was slow with an extended period of ice pellets in many areas.  It was not uncommon to receive reports of an inch or more of accumulation of the ice pellets.  The transition eventually worked its way southeast across the state and by sunrise on the 9th all of the Des Moines CWA had changed over to snow.

This is about 3 miles southeast of Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.  Six buildings sustained considerable damage, mainly to roofs, windows, and to exteriors.  A pawnshop in the shopping center lost part of its roof and a Pizza Hut, immediately next door, lost all of its windows.  Several other buildings in the area lost windows from flying debris.  A nearby Pep Boys Auto Parts store lots a large portion of its roof and exterior awnings.  The flying debris from the roof of the damaged buildings, particularly the Pep Boys store, caused damage to 15 to 20 cars parked nearby.  Many of the cars had their rear windows shattered out and appeared as if they had been hit with a major hailstorm, although no hail was reported in the area.  It is believed that rock pebbles from the roofs of the damaged buildings were largely responsible for this occurrence.  The flying debris and glass caused injury to 8 people.  The injuries were described as being mainly cuts and bruises, although one person suffered a broken arm.  Power lines were also reported down in the same area.","PDS"

The Interstate was closed at that point.  The Iowa State Highway Patrol closed Interstate 35 from U.S. Highway 20 north to the Minnesota border.  As the surface low continued to exit the region at a very fast pace, winds decreased during the mid and late afternoon hours.  Visibility increased over the enter blizzard to greater than three miles by the late afternoon.",,"PDS"

As the storm continued it's northeast trek across the central plains, the north winds increased to 30-40 mph resulting in a blizzard across most of central Kansas. Drifts were so deep across Russell and Barton counties that in a few instances street signs were nearly obliterated. Accidents were numerous and although most involved vehicles sliding off highways, a few were serious with injuries resulting. Area newspapers contributed greatly to this report.","PDS"

In fact, most of the snow on the ground was packed ice and not able to blow.  An area of light snow moved through northern Iowa between midnight and 6 AM CST.   Visibility decreased as wind driven snow in suspension swept southeast into Iowa out of Minnesota.  Just north of the Iowa border, significant snow had fallen and was able to blow.  Low level winds in excess of 70 MPH were able to transport the blowing snow south.  Visibility decreased to under one quarter of a mile very rapidly over the north central sections of the state.  Numerous roads, in fact nearly all, were closed due to poor visibility and drifting snow.  A serious accident occurred in Interstate 35 south of Clear Lake involving three tractor semi-trailers and several cars.  Reports from emergency personnel indicated ambulance rescue was nearly impossible, and in fact delayed for a period, as it was not possible to determine whether they were traveling in the northbound or southbound lane of the interstate.  The Interstate was closed at that point.  The Iowa State Highway Patrol closed Interstate 35 from U.S. Highway 20 north to the Minnesota border.  As the surface low continued to exit the region at a very fast pace, winds decreased during the mid and late afternoon hours.  Visibility increased over the enter blizzard to greater than three miles by the late afternoon.",,"PDS"

Amounts of 8 to 16 inches were common in southern Worcester County, with 4 to 8 inches in the Greater Boston area.  Amounts of 2 to 4 inches were reported across much of the South Shore, but the combination of snow and strong winds created a significant impact to travelers.  Northeast winds gusted to 58 mph in Provincetown, and Nantucket reported sustained winds of 40 mph with frequent gusts to 50 mph.  Most of the state experienced wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph during the height of the storm.  About 12,000 electric customers were left without power.   Nearly 200 flights were canceled at Logan International Airport because of the storm, and the airport was forced to briefly close twice for snow removal.One death was indirectly attributed to this storm, when an 87-year-old woman was killed in a car accident on Route 169 in Charlton.",,"PDS"
