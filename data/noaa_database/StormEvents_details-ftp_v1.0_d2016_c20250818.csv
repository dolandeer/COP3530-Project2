This allowed a very warm and excessively humid air mass to be in place over the area.  As temperatures rose through the 80s and into the 90s, dewpoints were unusually high in the mid to upper 70s.  By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.","Large tree limbs were reported down on Wyndon Road and Wheeler Drive due to thunderstorm winds.","CSV"

Lake effect snow slowly trailed off through the overnight hours Monday and early morning hours of Tuesday. Specific storm totals off Lake Erie included:  19 inches at Little Valley, 18 inches at Perrysburg, 17 inches at Randolph, 16 inches at Franklinville; and 12 inches at Mayville and Sardinia.|Off of Lake Ontario light snow fell across the Saint Lawrence valley through the early afternoon hours of Sunday, January 17th.   A well-defined band of lake effect snow formed late Sunday night, and early Monday morning on a westerly flow. This band of snow arced across northern Oswego County and the southern Tug Hill through the early morning hours of Monday, January 18th.  Just before dawn veering winds organized the band of lake effect snow over the Wayne-Cayuga-Oswego corridor. This band of snow increased in intensity to over 3 inches per hour by midday Monday bringing dangerous travel conditions over the southeast shoreline of Lake Ontario and inland. This band of snow at times had upstream connection to not only Georgian Bay but also Lake Superior. While the main band of lake effect snow off Lake Ontario flew over the southeast shoreline Monday, there was another band of snow, originating off Lake Huron, and across southwestern Lake Ontario that brought several inches of snow through the day across Niagara, Orleans and western Monroe counties. This northwest flow over Lake Ontario continued varying intensity to the snow bands through the night and into Tuesday, with subtle variations in the wind flow carrying the snows over the southern and southeastern shorelines. Though this event ended Tuesday, light to moderate bands of snow continued along the southern and southeastern shorelines of Lake Ontario through Thursday adding several additional inches of snow. Specific storm totals off Lake Ontario included:  22 inches at Fulton, 19 inches at Redfield, 17 inches at Mannsville, 15 inches at Osceola, 13 inches at Irondequoit, 12 inches at Lorraine, 11 inches at Pulaski, 10 inches at Marion and 9 inches at Sterling.","","CSV"

In seeking federal disaster aid, Governor Chris Christie announced the storm cost the state of New Jersey $82.6 million in damages and expenses. Federal Disaster Aid was requested for the following counties Burlington,Camden, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex , Monmouth, Morris, Ocean,Somerset and Warren Counties. The Governor has also requested the Small Business Act provide relief of up to $40K in loans for homeowners and $200K for businesses. In Ocean County the estimated cost is $465,000 for snow removal for overtime pay, fuel and treatment chemicals. On March 15, 2016, President Obama declared the following counties federal disaster areas: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Somerset, and Warren, in addition to Bergen, Essex, Hudson, and Union counties. This declaration makes federal funding available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation and snow assistance for a continuous 48-hour period during the storm. ||Moderate to major flooding occurred along the New Jersey coast and associated back bays during this event.

The entire Raritan Bayshore suffered minor damage, while moderate damage began appearing in central Monmouth County. Heading south along the coast, the first instance of major damage appeared in Bay Head, Ocean County. A 100 foot flag pole was knocked off it's base in Ocean County due to the strong winds as well. Long Beach Township had to order 1,250 truckloads of sand to replace the lost sand. In addition, a 3.5 mile long steel wall along Brick and Normandy beaches were exposed which closed the beaches. Significant funds will need to be spent to replenish the sand. Damage in Sea Isle City was near $25 M in beach damage. In Burlington County, $4.7 M was spent on snow removal with $279K spent in Evesham and $189K in Mount Laurel. ||New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declared a State of Emergency on Friday, January 22nd for the duration of the event.

Corn had broken or bruised stalks, along with dislodged roots and leaf loss from the wind and hail. ||The northern storm went from Alexandria, southeast to Paynesville, Buffalo and the northwest part of the Twin Cities metro area. Eventually this storm moved across most of the Twin Cities metro area, with the most damage from northern Hennepin, through Ramsey and southern Washington.  ||The second storm followed a similar path from west central Minnesota, southeast to just north of the Minnesota River Valley, then across the southern part of the Twin Cities metro area. The two storms merged across southern Minnesota from near Faribault, northeast to Red Wing, and to near Eau Claire Wisconsin. This storm rapidly moved southeast and became a large bow echo that raced across southern Wisconsin, and northern Illinois by Wednesday morning.  ||The northern storm produced several measured wind gusts in excess of 70 mph across Wright, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington counties. The worst damage which a storm survey estimated winds near 80 mph, produced a six mile long damage path of downed transmission lines near St. Michaels and Rogers. As the storms moved into the western metro area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with measured severe wind gusts at both Crystal and Flying Cloud airports. The downtown St. Paul airport also measured a severe wind gust as the storms moved into Ramsey and into Washington county. The Maple Grove hospital had structural damage to their building. Pavers from an upper roof blew off and penetrated a roof below. This caused rain to seep into patient rooms and to the 1st floor imaging and PCC. ||There were some issues related to flooded roads in the Minneapolis, St. Paul metropolitan area, but most of the flooded roads were concentrated in poor drainage where rain water had no place to go.  ||The second and southern storm initially produced several large hail reports, up to 2 inches in diameter from Cosmos to Hutchinson. This storm began to bow out in the southwest suburbs of the Twin Cities near Jordon, Prior Lake and Burnsville and moved southeast. This storm produced two tornadoes, one east of  Faribault, and another west of Goodhue.||During the height of the storm, Xcel Energy reported more than 138,000 customers without power.","","CSV"

This excessive rainfall caused record flooding of the Illinois River near Watts and Tahlequah; major flooding of the Baron Fork near Eldon, the Flint Creek near Kansas, the Arkansas River near Muskogee, and the Poteau River near Poteau and Panama.  Although all of this flooding began in late December 2015, the flooding of the Poteau River continued into early January 2016.","The Poteau River near Panama rose above its flood stage of 29 feet at 12:15 am CST on December 27th. The river crested at 44.97 feet at 12:15 am CST on the 29th, resulting in major flooding.

The well aligned westerly flow supported snow fall rates of an inch per hour at times across the western Southern Tier and Tug Hill Plateau. The peak of the lake snows occurred on New Year���s Day (Friday).  Well organized bands off both Lakes Erie and Ontario pushed north towards Buffalo and Watertown during the morning as a shortwave approached the region.  Snowfall rates of one to two inches an hour and reports of thunder and lightning were found within the moving band.  During the afternoon in the wake of a shortwave, the steering flow veered to the west and the corresponding bands of moderate to heavy lake snow settled back to the south.  This placed the steadiest lake snows over the western Southern Tier and southern portions of the Tug Hill Plateau. On Saturday, January 2nd, the bands of lake effect lifted north then again shifted south as they weakened. Specific snowfall totals off Lake Erie included:  12 inches at Perrysburg, Elma, Bennington; 10 inches at Hamburg; 9 inches at Colden and Wyoming; and 8 inches in South Wales.

The hurricane brought 6 to 12 inches of rain and up to 18 inches to some areas of southeast North Carolina, with the bulk of the rainfall occurring within a 12 hour period. This rain fell on wet to in some cases saturated soil due to much above normal rainfall in September. The result was historic flooding; widespread flash flooding, and an extended period of major to record river flooding. Matthew's flooding rains, surge and wind brought loss of life, displaced tens of thousands of people, and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in structural damage as homes and businesses were devastated or totally destroyed. Major infrastructure will have to be repaired or rebuilt.","Hurricane Matthew moved up the eastern seaboard, bringing very heavy rain and strong winds. Rainfall amounts over 12 inches occurred in multiple areas of the county. Wind gusts were surprisingly high, with a gust to 67 mph at the Lumberton Airport.  Tropical storm force winds and flooded ground caused widespread tree and power line damage. The river gauge at the Lumber River at Lumberton failed, however the high watermark data from the U.S. Geological Survey indicated the water level may have reached over 25 feet. This exceeded the previous record by over 4 feet. This level bypassed the levee that protects parts of Lumberton from the river due to water passing under I-95 via VFR road. One elderly male died in his home on West Fifth Street on 10/9. The man had a heart condition and when power was lost, he was without oxygen. The family believes he may have died of a heart attack and then fell into flood waters which had overtaken his home from the Lumber River. The Lumber River also exceeded record levels at Boardman by about 2.5 feet. This resulted in the closure of U. S. Route 74, the main route between Wilmington and Lumberton. Numerous water rescues were required along and near the Lumber River. Many homes were flooded in Pembroke. This was one of the hardest hit counties due to the historic river flooding. The offices of the Robesonian Newspaper were flooded.","CSV"

Two small bow echoes tracked through south central Nebraska, from Interstate 80 south to the state line, and another across central Nebraska which affected Valley and Greeley Counties.

Widespread heavy rain developed on October 8th and continued through early on October 9th as Matthew approached and moved offshore of the coast. Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County.

Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas.

Widespread heavy rain developed on October 8th and continued through early on October 9th as Matthew approached and moved offshore of the coast. Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County.

Widespread heavy rain developed on October 8th and continued through early on October 9th as Matthew approached and moved offshore of the coast. Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County.

Thunderstorms had developed over western Kansas by mid-afternoon and, by 5:30 p.m. CST, they began moving into north central Kansas. The storms were mostly short line-segments of multicell storms, but there was one supercell that lifted out of Ellis County into southeastern Rooks County. This storm was producing a tornado upon entering Rooks County, but the tornado quickly dissipated after crossing into the County. This supercell cycled and did spawn another short-track EF-1 tornado just northeast of where the previous tornado ended. This storm then merged with the developing squall line which swept east across the rest of north central Kansas. Severe hail was reported in many locations across Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell Counties, the largest of which was 2 inches over west-central Osborne County. This line of storms exited north central Kansas by 11 p.m. CST. However, new severe thunderstorms were already developing to the southwest, apparently along the outflow boundary left by the preceding storms. These storms produced hail up to the size of golf balls in multiple locations between 11:15 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. CST. Cell training occurred with these storms and, when combined with the previous line, a CoCoRaHS observer measured 3.77 inches of rain which fell in less than 12 hours.||A low pressure center was located over western Kansas. A warm front extended east from this low through northern Kansas. This front lifted north into Nebraska during the afternoon hours. These storms developed in the vicinity of this front and in the warm sector. Prior to convective initiation, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the middle 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, between 8 and 8.5 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE between 1500 and 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was between 35 and 40 knots. In the upper-levels, split flow was over North America, with a closed low over Wyoming and Colorado.","This tornado was the continuation and end of the tornado that started in Ellis County north of the town of Catharine. In Rooks County, the overall damage was minimal and confined to trees as the tornado lifted within a mile of the county line. The entire path length through the 2 counties was 7 miles. At its peak in Ellis County, the maximum wind speed was estimated to be 125 MPH.","CSV"

Isolated storms began developing over Dawson County around 3 p.m. CST. Hail up to the size of half dollars was reported in Cozad. As the late afternoon and evening hours wore on, more storms developed over south central Nebraska. Most of them were not severe, but nickel to quarter size hail fell over parts of Dawson County between 7 and 8 p.m. CST. Hail up 1.5 inches in diameter fell over part of Sherman County as well. Thunderstorms eventually formed into two small arc's. One formed from the Sandhills back down to Lexington. The other formed over northern Kansas and its northern fringe moved into south central Nebraska. This second arc produced wind damage in Minden and Red Cloud, with downed trees and snapped off tree limbs. Winds at Red Cloud were estimated around 75 mph.||A low pressure center was located over western Kansas. A warm front extended east from this low through northern Kansas. This front lifted north into Nebraska during the afternoon hours. These storms developed in the vicinity of this front and in the warm sector. Prior to convective initiation, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the middle 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, between 8 and 8.5 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE between 1500 and 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was between 35 and 40 knots. In the upper levels, split flow was over North America, with a closed low over Wyoming and Colorado.","","CSV"

This particular track focused the heaviest precipitation across east-central Illinois, mainly east of the I-55 corridor.  Snowfall amounts generally ranged from 3 to 6 inches: however, very strong northerly winds gusting as high as 45 to 55 mph created blizzard conditions for several hours.  Considerable blowing and drifting snow reduced visibility to less than 1/4 mile at times, and caused numerous traffic accidents.  One person died in Cumberland County as a result of a collision with a semi truck.","Weather observers across Vermilion County reported snowfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches, with drifts between 1 and 2 feet.  Winds gusting to between 40 and 50 mph created whiteout conditions from 1000 to 1500 CST.  Snow-covered roads and poor visibility due to falling and blowing snow contributed to numerous traffic accidents across the county, especially on I-74 where part of the road west of Danville was closed.

Several bands of lake effect snow passed east of Lake Erie through the day and night Wednesday, while upstream connections to Lake Huron over the western half of Lake Ontario and later Georgian Bay over the eastern half of Lake Ontario maintained bands of snow along the southern shoreline of Lake Ontario.  By Wednesday evening the lake effect snows focused southeast of Lake Ontario where a band of snow with snowfall rates in excess of 3 inches per hour sat over Oswego County. This band of snow moved little through the night, and this allowed for upwards of three feet of snow to fall upon Oswego County by Thursday morning. Through the day Thursday winds veered to more northwesterly and produced light multi-banded lake effect streamers to the south and southeast of the lakes through the day.

A west wind brought the steadiest snows east of Lake Erie across ski country through the day, while on the southwestern shoreline of Lake Ontario a band of snow hugged the shoreline, dropping upwards of a half a foot of snow.  Several bands of lake effect snow passed east of Lake Erie through the day and night Wednesday, while upstream connections to Lake Huron over the western half of Lake Ontario and later Georgian Bay over the eastern half of Lake Ontario maintained bands of snow along the southern shoreline of Lake Ontario.  By Wednesday evening the lake effect snows focused southeast of Lake Ontario where a band of snow with snowfall rates in excess of 3 inches per hour sat over Oswego County. This band of snow moved little through the night, and this allowed for upwards of three feet of snow to fall upon Oswego County by Thursday morning.

A west wind brought the steadiest snows east of Lake Erie across ski country through the day, while on the southwestern shoreline of Lake Ontario a band of snow hugged the shoreline, dropping upwards of a half a foot of snow.  Several bands of lake effect snow passed east of Lake Erie through the day and night Wednesday, while upstream connections to Lake Huron over the western half of Lake Ontario and later Georgian Bay over the eastern half of Lake Ontario maintained bands of snow along the southern shoreline of Lake Ontario.  By Wednesday evening the lake effect snows focused southeast of Lake Ontario where a band of snow with snowfall rates in excess of 3 inches per hour sat over Oswego County. This band of snow moved little through the night, and this allowed for upwards of three feet of snow to fall upon Oswego County by Thursday morning. Through the day Thursday winds veered to more northwesterly and produced light multi-banded lake effect streamers to the south and southeast of the lakes through the day. Off Lake Erie, specific snowfall reports included:  14 inches at East Aurora and 10 inches at Colden and Elma.

The poor timing of the snow band during the early morning rush led to several accidents, and slowing the morning commute. The band of snow weakened some during the morning hours as it sank southward back over southern Erie and Chautauqua Counties. By late morning the band of snow lifted northward across Niagara, Orleans and northern Erie counties.  Here is where the greatest snowfall accumulation fell, with upwards of a foot of snow falling through the afternoon and evening hours. During the late afternoon hours several rumbles of thunder were heard over Northern Erie County.  Through the evening hours this band of snow sank southward towards the southern tier where it then diminished to light snow showers after midnight.|Off of Lake Ontario an early lake effect snow band was over Oswego County Friday morning. As winds backed through the morning hours this band of snow lifted northward and disorganized as it reached central and northern Jefferson County where it then intensified through the afternoon hours. With some help from Lake Erie, a southwest to northeast band of snow blitzed the Saint Lawrence Valley and northern Jefferson County with nearly a foot of snow through the afternoon hours. Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour fell through the afternoon. By early evening a southward dropping arctic front pushed this band of snow southward.  |Off Lake Erie, specific snowfall reports included: 11 inches at Rapids, Lockport and Elma, 10 inches at North Tonawanda and 8 inches at Hamburg.

While warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico filtered north and encompassed the region, a series of potent upper level disturbances began lifting northeast across the Lower Mississippi River Valley. This set the stage for multiple rounds of torrential rains that fell almost continuously across the ArkLaMiss from March 8th through March 12th. These prolonged torrential rains resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding across the region, with numerous area rivers reaching moderate and major flood stages. Floodwaters damaged numerous homes, businesses, and closed many primary and secondary roads across the region, with some secondary roads washed out. ||As the storm system finally exited the region late on the 12th, another fast moving, compact storm system followed in its wake during the evening of March 13th. This system brought another round of heavy rain to the Delta region, in addition to several reports of hail and damaging straight line winds. Tornadoes were spawned by this system as well, which included one that affected Chicot County.","This tornado started on the southwest side of Dermott just west of Buckner Lane. Here several trees were snapped. As it crossed Buckner, six power poles were taken down. It then crossed Trotter Street, where more trees were snapped with others uprooted. A fence was laid down as well. A few homes here had minor roof damage where shingles were blown off. The tornado then tracked across US Highway 165 where it moved through open field. It tracked into the South Delta Regional Correctional Facility. Quite a bit of damage was done to the facility as it took a direct hit. Several large sections of the outer fence were torn down. Five buildings on the south side of the complex sustained roof damage where shingles and sheet paper were removed. The gym building, a metal structure, was heavily damaged where a large section of wall was removed. The main building of the complex suffered roof damage where roughly half of the roof was lifted or had parts removed. The roof is not a typical roof; it has several layers. Large portions of the foam insulation were pulled out along with several sections of a thin roof covering. A couple of the guard watch towers had the windows blown out and some minor damage. One employee was injured trying to exit a tower and broke a leg. The tornado then moved into a wooded area, where trees were snapped and a metal carport was thrown and destroyed. As the tornado crossed Highway 35, many more trees were damaged. One home sustained minor roof damage on the south side of the highway. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and snapped more trees. It then continued through a large wooded area and farmland and it moved into Desha County. It then crossed Highway 159 where many more trees were snapped and uprooted. Where it crossed Highway 159, a home sustained some minor roof damage and had the wood framed shed destroyed. A few power lines were down here as well. The tornado continued northeast into a wooded area where more trees were damaged. Though the tornado likely dissipated a bit farther east, no access was available to that area due to flooding. The total path length was 9.2 miles, with 2.6 miles of that in Desha County. The maximum estimated winds were 105 mph.","CSV"
