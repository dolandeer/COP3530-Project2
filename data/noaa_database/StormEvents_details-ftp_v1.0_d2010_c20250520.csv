Unfortunately, temperatures remained too low to allow substantial melting of the considerable Iowa snowpack during this dry spell.   Rain, mostly in the light to moderate category, was frequent and widespread from the 6th through the 13th.   The rain was accompanied by much warmer temperatures and resulted in rapid snowmelt.   Snow cover, which ranged from 1 to 7 inches along the Missouri border to as much as 30 inches in northwest Iowa at the beginning of the month, was gone by March 17 (with the exception of some drifts).   The combination of snow melt and rainfall pushed nearly all Iowa rivers above flood stage with major flooding reported at some northern Iowa locations.   Despite much drier weather during the second one-half of March, flooding continued at month���s end along the Des Moines River, the Mississippi River below Muscatine and over parts of northwest Iowa.    Rainfall amounts for the month were generally above normal over southern Iowa and well below normal over the northeast.   Rain totals varied from 0.58 inches at Waukon to 4.09 inches at Beaconsfield.   There was only one snow event of consequence during the month.   Snow fell over all but far northern Iowa on the 19th-20th with greatest amounts in the south where 6 or more inches fell at Murray, Lacona, Indianola, Newton, and Des Moines.   The statewide average snowfall was 2.0 inches for the month, or 2.8 inches less than normal.   This ranks as the 23rd lowest March total among 123 years of record.   However, the meager March snowfall was enough to push the statewide average seasonal snowfall total to 47.7 inches or seventh highest of record (greatest total since 1978-1979 winter).  With the month starting out with an extensive snow and water content in the snow pack of 2 to as much as 10 inches, flooding was a virtual certainty across the CWA.  Due to the slow melt, most rivers crested on the high end of moderate intensity, with a few reaching major flood stage.  Initially, ice jamming was a significant problem.  Some of the worst occurred on the Raccoon west of Des Moines, resulting in flash flooding.  Flash flooding also occurred in the the Fort Dodge area with considerable flooding in the town of Fort Dodge.  Scattered ice jams also occurred in north central and northwest Iowa in the Mason City and Estherville areas.  Much of the flooding was to agricultural lands for much of the period, however cities along the rivers were inundated by the flood waters.  It was fortunate that heavy rainfall did not occur during the melting process.  Much of Iowa avoided what could have been a major disaster.","","CSV"

Many locations received less than 2 inches of rainfall. Drought conditions and fire activity worsened during the month. Monthly precipitiation totals ranged from less than 0.50 inches in portions of central Indiana to 3.50 inches near Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana. This was 10% of normal in portions of central Indiana to 125% of normal in portions of northwest and east central Indiana. Nearly one-half of the state received less than an inch of rain during October.||Drought conditions gradually deteriorated during October. The National Drought Monitor for October 5 indicated nearly 50% of the Indiana with moderate (D1) to severe (D2) drought conditions. By the end of October, moderate (D1) to extreme (D3) drought conditions had spread to nearly all of the state. The National Drought Monitor for November 2nd indicated that virtually all of Indiana south of U.S. Highway 36 was in severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought. Extreme (D3) drought conditions prevailed in much of south central Indiana. Here are some of the impacts of the drought.||Here are some of the agricultural impacts this month. The Indiana Weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report released on November 1st indicated that 98% of the corn and soybean acreage had been harvested (record harvest pace). Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana.

Many locations received less than 2 inches of rainfall. Drought conditions and fire activity worsened during the month. Monthly precipitiation totals ranged from less than 0.50 inches in portions of central Indiana to 3.50 inches near Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana. This was 10% of normal in portions of central Indiana to 125% of normal in portions of northwest and east central Indiana. Nearly one-half of the state received less than an inch of rain during October.||Drought conditions gradually deteriorated during October. The National Drought Monitor for October 5 indicated nearly 50% of the Indiana with moderate (D1) to severe (D2) drought conditions. By the end of October, moderate (D1) to extreme (D3) drought conditions had spread to nearly all of the state. The National Drought Monitor for November 2nd indicated that virtually all of Indiana south of U.S. Highway 36 was in severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought. Extreme (D3) drought conditions prevailed in much of south central Indiana. Here are some of the impacts of the drought.||Here are some of the agricultural impacts this month. The Indiana Weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report released on November 1st indicated that 98% of the corn and soybean acreage had been harvested (record harvest pace). Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana. Consequently, the flow in the White, East Fork White and Wabash Rivers was below normal. The lowest river flow, when compared to normal, was in southwest Indiana. In central Indiana, all Indianapolis water supply reservoirs and Monroe Lake ranged from 2 to 4.5 feet below normal lake levels.","On October 12th, the U.S. Drought Monitor placed all of Monroe County under an Severe (D2) Drought designation.

Many locations received less than 2 inches of rainfall. Drought conditions and fire activity worsened during the month. Monthly precipitiation totals ranged from less than 0.50 inches in portions of central Indiana to 3.50 inches near Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana. This was 10% of normal in portions of central Indiana to 125% of normal in portions of northwest and east central Indiana. Nearly one-half of the state received less than an inch of rain during October.||Drought conditions gradually deteriorated during October. The National Drought Monitor for October 5 indicated nearly 50% of the Indiana with moderate (D1) to severe (D2) drought conditions. By the end of October, moderate (D1) to extreme (D3) drought conditions had spread to nearly all of the state. The National Drought Monitor for November 2nd indicated that virtually all of Indiana south of U.S. Highway 36 was in severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought. Extreme (D3) drought conditions prevailed in much of south central Indiana. Here are some of the impacts of the drought.||Here are some of the agricultural impacts this month. The Indiana Weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report released on November 1st indicated that 98% of the corn and soybean acreage had been harvested (record harvest pace). Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana. Consequently, the flow in the White, East Fork White and Wabash Rivers was below normal. The lowest river flow, when compared to normal, was in southwest Indiana. In central Indiana, all Indianapolis water supply reservoirs and Monroe Lake ranged from 2 to 4.5 feet below normal lake levels.","On October 12th, the U.S. Drought Monitor placed all of Johnson County under a Severe (D2) Drought designation.

Many locations received less than 2 inches of rainfall. Drought conditions and fire activity worsened during the month. Monthly precipitiation totals ranged from less than 0.50 inches in portions of central Indiana to 3.50 inches near Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana. This was 10% of normal in portions of central Indiana to 125% of normal in portions of northwest and east central Indiana. Nearly one-half of the state received less than an inch of rain during October.||Drought conditions gradually deteriorated during October. The National Drought Monitor for October 5 indicated nearly 50% of the Indiana with moderate (D1) to severe (D2) drought conditions. By the end of October, moderate (D1) to extreme (D3) drought conditions had spread to nearly all of the state. The National Drought Monitor for November 2nd indicated that virtually all of Indiana south of U.S. Highway 36 was in severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought. Extreme (D3) drought conditions prevailed in much of south central Indiana. Here are some of the impacts of the drought.||Here are some of the agricultural impacts this month. The Indiana Weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report released on November 1st indicated that 98% of the corn and soybean acreage had been harvested (record harvest pace). Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana. Consequently, the flow in the White, East Fork White and Wabash Rivers was below normal. The lowest river flow, when compared to normal, was in southwest Indiana. In central Indiana, all Indianapolis water supply reservoirs and Monroe Lake ranged from 2 to 4.5 feet below normal lake levels.","On October 12th, the U.S. Drought Monitor placed a far southern sliver of Bartholomew County under an Extreme (D3) Drought designation.  This is an increase in intensity from the previous week's designation.  The remainder of the county remained at Severe (D2) from the previous month.  A countywide burn ban was also in effect.  This lasted through the end of the month of October.","CSV"

Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana. Consequently, the flow in the White, East Fork White and Wabash Rivers was below normal. The lowest river flow, when compared to normal, was in southwest Indiana. In central Indiana, all Indianapolis water supply reservoirs and Monroe Lake ranged from 2 to 4.5 feet below normal lake levels.","On October 12th, the U.S. Drought Monitor placed most of Jackson County under an Extreme (D3) Drought designation.  This is an increase in intensity from the previous week's designation.  The remainder of the county remained at Severe (D2) from the previous month.  A countywide burn ban was also in effect.  This lasted through the end of the month of October.","CSV"

The National Drought Monitor for November 2nd indicated that virtually all of Indiana south of U.S. Highway 36 was in severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought. Extreme (D3) drought conditions prevailed in much of south central Indiana. Here are some of the impacts of the drought.||Here are some of the agricultural impacts this month. The Indiana Weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report released on November 1st indicated that 98% of the corn and soybean acreage had been harvested (record harvest pace). Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana. Consequently, the flow in the White, East Fork White and Wabash Rivers was below normal. The lowest river flow, when compared to normal, was in southwest Indiana. In central Indiana, all Indianapolis water supply reservoirs and Monroe Lake ranged from 2 to 4.5 feet below normal lake levels.","On October 19th, the U.S. Drought Monitor placed the southeast quarter of Putnam County under a Severe (D2) Drought designation.  A countywide burn ban was also in effect.  This lasted through the end of the month of October.","CSV"

The home was approximately 4000 sq. ft in size, built in 1997, and its destruction was the basis of the EF-4 rating. Many of the nearby trees were completely snapped, with several near the home snapped off at the base. One single wide mobile home was also destroyed, with its remnants blown into a wooded area about 300 yards away. Another nearby home was moderately damaged, while two other homes suffered minor damage.

Meanwhile downslope regions received 2 to 6 inches of snowfall. In addition, brisk northwest winds of 15 to 25 mph with higher gusts caused considerable blowing and drfiting of the snow with 4 to 5 foot snow drifts reported.||A record 33.1 inches of snow fell with this storm at Burlington Int'l Airport in South Burlington, which surpassed the old record of 29.8 inches that occurred on December 25-28 in 1969. ||Some other specific snowfall totals; 30 inches in Essex Junction and Colchester (Chittenden county), 25 inches in Monkton (Addison county) and Milton (Chittenden county), 24 inches in Charlotte (Chittenden county), 22 inches in Jeffersonville (Lamoille county), Underhill and Jericho (Chittenden county), 18 inches in Canaan (Essex county) and Sheldon Springs (Franklin county), 16 inches in Cambridge (Lamoille county), 14 inches in Barton (Orleans county), Danby (Rutland county) and Lincoln (Addison county).","","CSV"

This winter system then plowed east-northeast through Kansas, Texas and Oklahoma Thursday and early Friday, January 28th and 29th.  This brought significant snowfall to much of southwest and south central Kansas.  The precipitation began as light snow late Wednesday night, then picked up and continued as heavy snow for much of Thursday and Thursday night.  While snow persisted Friday morning, January 29th, in parts of our southeastern CWA, not much additional accumulation occurred.  Reports received Friday morning, January 29th, revealed a 5 to 20 mile wide swath of 7 to 11 inches of snowfall fell along an axis from near Hudson in northeastern Stafford County, to north of Haviland in Kiowa County, through northern parts of both Ford and Gray Counties, to just north of Big Bow in extreme northeastern Stanton County.  On either side of this heavy band of snow, an area of 4 to 6 inches of snow fell, basically south of a line from Shallow Water in southeast Scott County to Brownell in northeast Ness County to Pfeifer in southeast Ellis County, as well as north of a line from Elkhart in southeast Morton County to near Ashland in Clark county to near Sawyer in southeastern Pratt County.  In northern parts of DDC���s CWA, as well as in southeastern parts, 2 to 4 inches of snow fell.  The highest snowfall report received from this event was 11 inches at Ingalls in Gray County, with drifts as high as 5 feet in the Dodge City area also reported.  Winds during the event were from the north to northwest at 20 to 35 mph, which caused many areas of deep drifting and widespread travel problems.","Snowfall of 6.4 inches was reported 8 miles north of Jetmore.","CSV"

This brought significant snowfall to much of southwest and south central Kansas.  The precipitation began as light snow late Wednesday night, then picked up and continued as heavy snow for much of Thursday and Thursday night.  While snow persisted Friday morning, January 29th, in parts of our southeastern CWA, not much additional accumulation occurred.  Reports received Friday morning, January 29th, revealed a 5 to 20 mile wide swath of 7 to 11 inches of snowfall fell along an axis from near Hudson in northeastern Stafford County, to north of Haviland in Kiowa County, through northern parts of both Ford and Gray Counties, to just north of Big Bow in extreme northeastern Stanton County.  On either side of this heavy band of snow, an area of 4 to 6 inches of snow fell, basically south of a line from Shallow Water in southeast Scott County to Brownell in northeast Ness County to Pfeifer in southeast Ellis County, as well as north of a line from Elkhart in southeast Morton County to near Ashland in Clark county to near Sawyer in southeastern Pratt County.  In northern parts of DDC���s CWA, as well as in southeastern parts, 2 to 4 inches of snow fell.  The highest snowfall report received from this event was 11 inches at Ingalls in Gray County, with drifts as high as 5 feet in the Dodge City area also reported.

This brought significant snowfall to much of southwest and south central Kansas.  The precipitation began as light snow late Wednesday night, then picked up and continued as heavy snow for much of Thursday and Thursday night.  While snow persisted Friday morning, January 29th, in parts of our southeastern CWA, not much additional accumulation occurred.  Reports received Friday morning, January 29th, revealed a 5 to 20 mile wide swath of 7 to 11 inches of snowfall fell along an axis from near Hudson in northeastern Stafford County, to north of Haviland in Kiowa County, through northern parts of both Ford and Gray Counties, to just north of Big Bow in extreme northeastern Stanton County.  On either side of this heavy band of snow, an area of 4 to 6 inches of snow fell, basically south of a line from Shallow Water in southeast Scott County to Brownell in northeast Ness County to Pfeifer in southeast Ellis County, as well as north of a line from Elkhart in southeast Morton County to near Ashland in Clark county to near Sawyer in southeastern Pratt County.  In northern parts of DDC���s CWA, as well as in southeastern parts, 2 to 4 inches of snow fell.  The highest snowfall report received from this event was 11 inches at Ingalls in Gray County, with drifts as high as 5 feet in the Dodge City area also reported.

Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong.

Ahead of the storm, temperatures warmed to several degrees above normal, and Fresno finally hit 80 on March 28th, the first time this year. The storm moved into northern California on the 29th, and slowly sagged southward on the 30th. A weak pre-frontal boundary did move south over the central San Joaquin Valley during the afternoon and evening of the 29th, triggering brief gusts to 25-30 mph.||Light rain and mountain snow spread into the northern part of the region during the morning of March 30th, but the main energy of the storm did not arrive until the next day. Rainfall amounts in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley generally were less than two tenths of an inch. However, there were reports of hail up to a half-inch in diameter as weak thunderstorms moved over the east side and south end of the San Joaquin Valley, and a funnel cloud was photographed northeast of the city of Fresno. Two-day snow totals of up to 21 inches were reported in the high country of the Southern Sierra Nevada. In the Kern County Mountains, gusts to 75 mph were measured, while gusts over 50 mph were observed in the Kern County deserts.||Despite a wet start to March���which saw Fresno receive 0.62 inch of rain in 3 days (March 2nd-4th)���rainfall tapered off sharply for the remainder of the month. Fresno had a monthly total of 0.96 inch, only 43.6 percent of the normal for March of 2.20 inches. Bakersfield fared even worse, with a total of only 0.25 inch for March. This was a mere 17.7 percent of the monthly normal of 1.41 inch. Even so, the rain season through March 31st was almost exactly normal for both cities (100.2 percent for Bakersfield; 101.1 percent for Fresno), due to above normal rainfalls during December through February (except near normal for Fresno in January).","","CSV"

Ahead of the storm, temperatures warmed to several degrees above normal, and Fresno finally hit 80 on March 28th, the first time this year. The storm moved into northern California on the 29th, and slowly sagged southward on the 30th. A weak pre-frontal boundary did move south over the central San Joaquin Valley during the afternoon and evening of the 29th, triggering brief gusts to 25-30 mph.||Light rain and mountain snow spread into the northern part of the region during the morning of March 30th, but the main energy of the storm did not arrive until the next day. Rainfall amounts in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley generally were less than two tenths of an inch. However, there were reports of hail up to a half-inch in diameter as weak thunderstorms moved over the east side and south end of the San Joaquin Valley, and a funnel cloud was photographed northeast of the city of Fresno. Two-day snow totals of up to 21 inches were reported in the high country of the Southern Sierra Nevada. In the Kern County Mountains, gusts to 75 mph were measured, while gusts over 50 mph were observed in the Kern County deserts.||Despite a wet start to March���which saw Fresno receive 0.62 inch of rain in 3 days (March 2nd-4th)���rainfall tapered off sharply for the remainder of the month. Fresno had a monthly total of 0.96 inch, only 43.6 percent of the normal for March of 2.20 inches. Bakersfield fared even worse, with a total of only 0.25 inch for March. This was a mere 17.7 percent of the monthly normal of 1.41 inch. Even so, the rain season through March 31st was almost exactly normal for both cities (100.2 percent for Bakersfield; 101.1 percent for Fresno), due to above normal rainfalls during December through February (except near normal for Fresno in January).","","CSV"

The storm moved into northern California on the 29th, and slowly sagged southward on the 30th. A weak pre-frontal boundary did move south over the central San Joaquin Valley during the afternoon and evening of the 29th, triggering brief gusts to 25-30 mph.||Light rain and mountain snow spread into the northern part of the region during the morning of March 30th, but the main energy of the storm did not arrive until the next day. Rainfall amounts in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley generally were less than two tenths of an inch. However, there were reports of hail up to a half-inch in diameter as weak thunderstorms moved over the east side and south end of the San Joaquin Valley, and a funnel cloud was photographed northeast of the city of Fresno. Two-day snow totals of up to 21 inches were reported in the high country of the Southern Sierra Nevada. In the Kern County Mountains, gusts to 75 mph were measured, while gusts over 50 mph were observed in the Kern County deserts.||Despite a wet start to March���which saw Fresno receive 0.62 inch of rain in 3 days (March 2nd-4th)���rainfall tapered off sharply for the remainder of the month. Fresno had a monthly total of 0.96 inch, only 43.6 percent of the normal for March of 2.20 inches. Bakersfield fared even worse, with a total of only 0.25 inch for March. This was a mere 17.7 percent of the monthly normal of 1.41 inch. Even so, the rain season through March 31st was almost exactly normal for both cities (100.2 percent for Bakersfield; 101.1 percent for Fresno), due to above normal rainfalls during December through February (except near normal for Fresno in January).","","CSV"

The activity continued through Saturday (3rd) and then strengthened in place Saturday Night as a large area of moisture spiraled around a massive coastal storm off New England.  A general burst of moderate to heavy snow accompanied this synoptic feature as it dropped south and southwest across the entire region during Sunday, then finally the lake effect weakened and retreated to near the lakes again Sunday night.  This event was unique in many ways, most notably in the large amounts of snow off Lake Ontario back across much of the Niagara frontier. A general one to two feet fell over two days, with up to 30 inches around Niagara Falls. Another area of very heavy snow focused on Wayne to Oswego County where two to three feet fell. The Rochester area caught a bit less, but still up to 18 inches near the Lake.  Off Lake Erie, two feet or more fell near Chautauqua Lake from Mayville to Jamestown. |Specific snowfall totals Off Lake Erie included:  Mayville 31���; Jamestown 28���; and Perrysburg 26���.
