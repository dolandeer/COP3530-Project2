Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses.

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water. Total Accumulations included (going from the northwest to southeast across the state): in Sussex County 15 inches in High Point, 14.7 inches in Culver Lake, 13.5 inches in  Wantage, 9.5 inches in Sparta and 8 inches in Sussex; in Warren County 12 inches in Phillipsburg and 11 inches in Allamuchy; in Morris County 12 inches in Oak Ridge, 11 inches in Long Valley, 9 inches in Whippany and Rockaway and 6 inches in Madison; in Hunterdon County 13 inches in White House Station, 11.5 inches in Califon and 10 inches in Flemington and Wertsville; in Somerset County 10.5 inches in Neshanic, 10 inches in Pottersville and 9 inches in Branchburg and Somerville, in Middlesex County 6 inches in New Brunswick and Woodbridge, in Monmouth County 7 inches in Ocean Grove and Manasquan, 6 inches in Howell and Union Beach; in Mercer County 10 inches in Washington's Crossing, 8 inches in Princeton and Hightstown; in Burlington County 13 inches in Moorestown, 10 inches in Lumberton and Marlton, 9 inches in Mount Laurel and 7 inches in Bordentown; in Ocean County 10 inches in Brick, 9 inches in Brant Beach and 8 inches in Jackson; in Camden County 14 inches in Gloucester City, 11 inches in Somerdale, 10 inches in Pennsauken and 8 inches in Cherry Hill; in Gloucester County 13 inches in Sewell and Mullica Hill, 11.5 inches in Swedesboro; in Salem County 10.3 inches in Deepwater; in Cumberland County 9 inches in Seabrook, 8 inches in Millville and 7 inches in Vineland; in Atlantic County 10 inches in Pomona, 9 inches in Estell Manor and 8.3 inches at the Atlantic City International Airport and in Cape May County 10 inches in North Wildwood, 8.5 inches in Cape May City and 8 inches in Cape May Courthouse. The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

The snowfall became heavy early on the 25th with snowfall rates estimated at 4 inches per hour. A north-to-south oriented band of heavy snow remained in place over Moore, Lee, Wake, Franklin, Granville, Vance, and Warren counties for several hours. Snowfall amounts exceeded 20 inches in some locations in these counties. The western Piedmont counties recorded 8 to 12 inches of snow, while the Coastal Plain received 4 to 8 inches of snow with light icing at the end of the event. The heavy snow brought central North Carolina to a standstill. Many roads were impassable, and power outages were reported across the entire area. Statewide, an estimated 260,000 people were without power, mostly in the Sandhills. Strong, gusty winds produced snow drifts several feet high.

Meanwhile, low pressure extended from southern Ohio on down the entire length of the Ohio River  during that afternoon.  A southerly wind at the surface, with dew points in the 55 to 60 degree range, fed moisture north from Tennessee and Kentucky.   This moisture was advected into the  boundary along the Ohio River.   Additional rains sank south into western and central West Virginia during the afternoon of the 18th, reaching the Charleston to Sutton corridor around 1500E.   The southern edge of the rain lifted a bit further north during the early evening hours, temporarily ending the rain around Charleston and Huntington.   Thunderstorms formed during the evening of the 18th, then pressed south again, as the low pressure passed just to the north of the affected area.  Rains diminished from west to east between 2000E on the 18th to 0400E on the 19th.  Rain amounts of 2 to 4 inches in 18 hours was common from a Huntington-Charleston-Elkins line on northwest .

National Guard support reached a peak of about 250 troops in the flood clean-up efforts.  The preliminary damage assessment included 35 homes or mobile homes destroyed in the 17 counties.  A total of 350 home, mobile homes, and businesses sustained major damage.   Private bridges over the small streams were damaged.  Seventeen of these bridges were damaged in Kanawha County, 16 in Calhoun County, and 12 in Braxton County.     A failed rescue along Kanawha Two Mile Creek, just outside the city limits of Charleston, resulted in 3 fatalities around 1845 to 1900E on the 18th.  The incident occurred at a Rich Oil gas station along a flood prone section of Route 21.   Five employees of the gas station and small store were loaded into a zodiac raft by 2 firefighters, in an attempt to ferry them to safety.  The water was 2 to 3 feet around the gas station.  The raft overturned, spilling the occupants into the water.  None of the store employees were outfitted with floatation life jackets during the rescue attempt.

Specific accumulations included 7 inches at Albany, while East Caroga Lake got buried with 21, and 18 inches fell at Gloversville, both located in  Fulton county. 17 inches fell at Fort Plain, Montgomery county and 16 at North Creek, Warren county. 	The storm once again closed many schools and some businesses. The snow removal effort was made more difficult due to the large amount of snow still left from previous storms.",,"PDC"

The rest of central North Carolina received a thin coating of less than a quarter inch, creating patchy spots of ice on roads and causing downed trees and power lines. Approximately 30,000 people were without power across the state at the peak of the storm.

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water.

The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water.

The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore.

About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th.

The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

Meanwhile, low pressure extended from southern Ohio on down the entire length of the Ohio River  during that afternoon.  A southerly wind at the surface, with dew points in the 55 to 60 degree range, fed moisture north from Tennessee and Kentucky.   This moisture was advected into the  boundary along the Ohio River.   Additional rains sank south into western and central West Virginia during the afternoon of the 18th, reaching the Charleston to Sutton corridor around 1500E.   The southern edge of the rain lifted a bit further north during the early evening hours, temporarily ending the rain around Charleston and Huntington.   Thunderstorms formed during the evening of the 18th, then pressed south again, as the low pressure passed just to the north of the affected area.  Rains diminished from west to east between 2000E on the 18th to 0400E on the 19th.  Rain amounts of 2 to 4 inches in 18 hours was common from a Huntington-Charleston-Elkins line on northwest .  An automated rain gauge near Beaver Run In Upshur County reported 4.6 inches.  In West Virginia, a total of 24 counties were under a state of emergency declared by Governor Underwood, 19 of which fell within this division of the state.  Later, on the 28th, President Clinton declared a federal disaster declaration for 20 counties, 17 of which are within this section of West Virginia.   The 17 counties included Barbour, Braxton, Cabell, Calhoun, Doddridge, Gilmer, Harrison, Jackson, Kanawha, Lewis, Mason, Putnam, Ritchie, Roane, Tyler, Upshur, and Wirt.   National Guard support reached a peak of about 250 troops in the flood clean-up efforts.  The preliminary damage assessment included 35 homes or mobile homes destroyed in the 17 counties.  A total of 350 home, mobile homes, and businesses sustained major damage.   Private bridges over the small streams were damaged.  Seventeen of these bridges were damaged in Kanawha County, 16 in Calhoun County, and 12 in Braxton County.     A failed rescue along Kanawha Two Mile Creek, just outside the city limits of Charleston, resulted in 3 fatalities around 1845 to 1900E on the 18th.  The incident occurred at a Rich Oil gas station along a flood prone section of Route 21.   Five employees of the gas station and small store were loaded into a zodiac raft by 2 firefighters, in an attempt to ferry them to safety.  The water was 2 to 3 feet around the gas station.  The raft overturned, spilling the occupants into the water.  None of the store employees were outfitted with floatation life jackets during the rescue attempt.  The body of a 53 year old woman was found in a nearby tree that night.  The body of a 52 year old man was discovered the next day in the stream.  The 56 year old female manager was not found until around 1300E on Sunday the 20th.  Her body had traveled some 140 miles, past 3 locks and dams, and was discovered in the Ohio River near Wheelersburg of Scioto County, Ohio.   A few days later, 2 teenage boys found her purse in a tree along Kanawha Two Mile.  The purse contained $6,000 from the store.    In this region of Kanawha County, Bonham and Tyler Mountain Elementary Schools received water damage.  In Ritchie County, most of the village of Cairo had been evacuated when flood waters rushed over the top of a temporary cofferdam, near North Bend State Park.   Homes and businesses in the community were flooded.  A 100 year old metal walking bridge over the North Branch of the Hughes River was washed away.  The community was completely cut off for 24 hours.  The sewage plants at Ellenboro and Cairo sustained damage.In Gilmer County, damage was from both small stream and river flooding.    In Roane County, the community of Reedy was hit hard, by the forks of Reedy Creek.  Water was higher than in March of 1997 and January of 1999.  A few homes had 1 to 2 feet of water in the living room.  Water made its way into the city building, the water-works office, the community center, the senior center, the post office, and the fire department.  Both stores in the community and the 3 churches were also affected by the high water.In Jackson County, the region around Sandyville, Liverpool, LeRoy, Lockhart, and Garfield were hardest hit.  One 80 year old resident near Liverpool  said, ""I've lived here all my life.  I've never seen the water here this high.""  The cooperative observer along Lockhart Fork reported 3.57 inches of rain.  The small stream of Lockhart Fork was about 6 inches lower than the crest in June, 1998.                               In Cabell County, the Enslow Park Blvd, Donald Ave section of Huntington, near Ritter Park was flooded by Fourpole Creek.   Water was 3 to 4 feet deep in the streets.  The city evacuated 54 homes.   Parked vehicles were  flooded. Middle Island Creek flooded portions of Doddridge, Tyler, and Pleasants County.  Governor Underwood was stranded on his Tyler County farm by the flooded secondary roads.  A helicopter had to pick the governor up at his farm, so he could take a tour of the damage.  River flooding followed the flash flooding along the small streams.  The most significant river flooding was along the upper reaches of  the Little Kanawha River.  The river crested at 31.3 feet at Glenville around 1200E on the 19th, more than 8 feet over flood stage.  Several businesses, including the 4 grocery stores, were affected by the high water.  It was the sixth highest crest on record at Glenville.  Further down the river, Grantsville of Calhoun County crested at 38.8 feet around 1700E on the 19th, not quite 3 feet above flood stage.   Only minor river flooding occurred along the lower reaches of the Little Kanawha, including the Happy Valley region of  Wood County.  The Tygart Valley River crested at 23.7 feet at Philippi around 1000E on the 19th.  Flood stage is 17 feet there.  Belington crested about 3 feet over flood stage at 17.1 feet around 1200E.  On the West Fork River near Clarksburg, the crest was 17.95 feet around 1200E on the 19th, almost 5 feet about the flood stage.The Buckhannon River in the community of Buckhannon crested at 26.2 feet around 1700E on the 19th.  Flood stage at Buckhannon is 23 feet.   Finally the mainstem of the Ohio River below Parkersburg saw minor flooding from the 19th into the 21st.  The crest at Point Pleasant was 42.1 feet around 0900E on the 21st.  Flood stage is 40 feet.  At Huntington the crest was 50.3 feet around 1000E on the 21st.

As the storm system matured, the dry slot swept out of the southern Plains into Illinois.  A deformation zone set up along the northwest edge of the dry slot with heavy snow setting up in a band from west central into northeast Iowa.  Snow fell at the rate of one to two inches an hour for a period of time.  Snowfall in the area was generally in the 6 to 9 inch range.  The heaviest snow fell in a band about 30 miles wide extending from near Boone, east-northeast to just south of Waterloo.  Numerous reports of 8.5 to 9 inches of snow were received from this area.  The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.

Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.  By Saturday morning, the 29th, temperatures had slowly fallen to near or just below the freezing mark over the north half of Georgia with a mix of light freezing drizzle, freezing rain, and sleet, with light snow in the mountains. The last batch of significant precipitation moved from Alabama into west central Georgia and on into the Atlanta metro area on Sunday morning. There were even one or two claps of thunder in Spalding county. Overall, the event generally produced 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accumulation, with isolated areas getting 1/2 to 1 inch of ice.

Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.

The western Piedmont counties recorded 8 to 12 inches of snow, while the Coastal Plain received 4 to 8 inches of snow with light icing at the end of the event. The heavy snow brought central North Carolina to a standstill. Many roads were impassable, and power outages were reported across the entire area.

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water. Total Accumulations included (going from the northwest to southeast across the state): in Sussex County 15 inches in High Point, 14.7 inches in Culver Lake, 13.5 inches in  Wantage, 9.5 inches in Sparta and 8 inches in Sussex; in Warren County 12 inches in Phillipsburg and 11 inches in Allamuchy; in Morris County 12 inches in Oak Ridge, 11 inches in Long Valley, 9 inches in Whippany and Rockaway and 6 inches in Madison; in Hunterdon County 13 inches in White House Station, 11.5 inches in Califon and 10 inches in Flemington and Wertsville; in Somerset County 10.5 inches in Neshanic, 10 inches in Pottersville and 9 inches in Branchburg and Somerville, in Middlesex County 6 inches in New Brunswick and Woodbridge, in Monmouth County 7 inches in Ocean Grove and Manasquan, 6 inches in Howell and Union Beach; in Mercer County 10 inches in Washington's Crossing, 8 inches in Princeton and Hightstown; in Burlington County 13 inches in Moorestown, 10 inches in Lumberton and Marlton, 9 inches in Mount Laurel and 7 inches in Bordentown; in Ocean County 10 inches in Brick, 9 inches in Brant Beach and 8 inches in Jackson; in Camden County 14 inches in Gloucester City, 11 inches in Somerdale, 10 inches in Pennsauken and 8 inches in Cherry Hill; in Gloucester County 13 inches in Sewell and Mullica Hill, 11.5 inches in Swedesboro; in Salem County 10.3 inches in Deepwater; in Cumberland County 9 inches in Seabrook, 8 inches in Millville and 7 inches in Vineland; in Atlantic County 10 inches in Pomona, 9 inches in Estell Manor and 8.3 inches at the Atlantic City International Airport and in Cape May County 10 inches in North Wildwood, 8.5 inches in Cape May City and 8 inches in Cape May Courthouse. The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

The one exception was across southern Union county where freezing rain lasted all night and through much of the morning on the 23rd. Ice accumulations reached damaging levels there around 3 am, causing a large number of trees and power lines to fall throughout the morning.

Aside from the shore, accumulations across the state averaged between 3 and 6 inches.  The snow caused many orthopedic injuries (fractured ankles and wrists) from nasty spills. Over a dozen people were also injured from sledding accidents. About two dozen traffic accidents were reported. Schools were closed on Thursday (the 20th) in Kent and Sussex Counties. The heavy snow forced the postponement of Governor Tom Carper's State of the State Address.  It was estimated the clean-up from this storm cost the state about 1.1 million dollars.

A deformation zone set up along the northwest edge of the dry slot with heavy snow setting up in a band from west central into northeast Iowa.

Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.

The heaviest snow fell in a band about 30 miles wide extending from near Boone, east-northeast to just south of Waterloo.  Numerous reports of 8.5 to 9 inches of snow were received from this area.  The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.  Damage was limited from the storm.  Though the snow was very wet and heavy, amounts were not great enough to cause major damage dow to loading.",,"PDC"

Patchy light snow began in west central and northwest Georgia around daybreak on the 28th. There was a light dusting on the ground by mid morning from Troup to Carroll county, east to Fayette county. Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.  By Saturday morning, the 29th, temperatures had slowly fallen to near or just below the freezing mark over the north half of Georgia with a mix of light freezing drizzle, freezing rain, and sleet, with light snow in the mountains. The last batch of significant precipitation moved from Alabama into west central Georgia and on into the Atlanta metro area on Sunday morning. There were even one or two claps of thunder in Spalding county. Overall, the event generally produced 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accumulation, with isolated areas getting 1/2 to 1 inch of ice. The main problems seemed to be traffic accidents due to icy roads and bridges. There were scattered areas of trees and power lines down, but damage from this storm was nowhere as much as that from the storm the previous weekend.",,"PDC"

Surface dew point temperatures soared into the mid 50s across Iowa in advance of an approaching dry line.  CAPE values were in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range.  The dry line entered southwest Iowa during the late afternoon.  Des points fell into the low to mid 30s behind the dry line.  A narrow line of thunderstorms erupted just ahead of the dry line.  For the most part, they were not severe, but many did produce pea to marble size hail.  A few reports of hail up to an inch in diameter  were received from Greene and Hamilton Counties.  As the line moved northeast, a microburst occurred over northeast Madison County.  High winds struck northeast of Winterset.  Reports indicate there was no rotation in the damage, however  one house was completely destroyed and three other houses in the area sustained damage.  In addition, two out buildings were damaged in the area.   The roof of the house was lifted off and carried 100 meters downstream to the northeast of the house.  A grove of pine trees was also flattened in the area.  Reports from law enforcement indicate there was no rotation visible and all dibris was blown toward the northeast.

A southerly wind at the surface, with dew points in the 55 to 60 degree range, fed moisture north from Tennessee and Kentucky.   This moisture was advected into the  boundary along the Ohio River.   Additional rains sank south into western and central West Virginia during the afternoon of the 18th, reaching the Charleston to Sutton corridor around 1500E.   The southern edge of the rain lifted a bit further north during the early evening hours, temporarily ending the rain around Charleston and Huntington.   Thunderstorms formed during the evening of the 18th, then pressed south again, as the low pressure passed just to the north of the affected area.

This was the first widespread accumulating snow of the winter season. The low intensified, but moved offshore to the eastnortheast relatively quickly.  This prevented substantial accumulations from occurring and also stopped heavy snow from spreading farther northwest into the state.  Accumulations were 3 to 6 inches to the southeast of the New Jersey Turnpike and generally 1 to 3 inches across the rest of the state. Snow spread across the state between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. EST on the 20th and fell at a steady rate throughout the day. The snow ended from the northwest part to the southeast part of the state during the evening, but took until a little after midnight to clear the southeast coast. The first snow of the season caused numerous accidents, over 100 accidents alone were reported in Middlesex County.  Within Middlesex County, in Edison, a bus driver suffered serious injuries in a three vehicle crash that caused major traffic backups.

Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.

Most of the snow fell during the overnight hours on Sunday into Monday morning. To the west of Albany, snow fell heavily, at times in excess of 3 inches per hour.  	Specific accumulations included 7 inches at Albany, while East Caroga Lake got buried with 21, and 18 inches fell at Gloversville, both located in  Fulton county. 17 inches fell at Fort Plain, Montgomery county and 16 at North Creek, Warren county. 	The storm once again closed many schools and some businesses. The snow removal effort was made more difficult due to the large amount of snow still left from previous storms.",,"PDC"

Patchy light snow began in west central and northwest Georgia around daybreak on the 28th. There was a light dusting on the ground by mid morning from Troup to Carroll county, east to Fayette county. Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.  By Saturday morning, the 29th, temperatures had slowly fallen to near or just below the freezing mark over the north half of Georgia with a mix of light freezing drizzle, freezing rain, and sleet, with light snow in the mountains. The last batch of significant precipitation moved from Alabama into west central Georgia and on into the Atlanta metro area on Sunday morning. There were even one or two claps of thunder in Spalding county. Overall, the event generally produced 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accumulation, with isolated areas getting 1/2 to 1 inch of ice. The main problems seemed to be traffic accidents due to icy roads and bridges. There were scattered areas of trees and power lines down, but damage from this storm was nowhere as much as that from the storm the previous weekend.",,"PDC"

Patchy light snow began in west central and northwest Georgia around daybreak on the 28th. There was a light dusting on the ground by mid morning from Troup to Carroll county, east to Fayette county. Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.  By Saturday morning, the 29th, temperatures had slowly fallen to near or just below the freezing mark over the north half of Georgia with a mix of light freezing drizzle, freezing rain, and sleet, with light snow in the mountains. The last batch of significant precipitation moved from Alabama into west central Georgia and on into the Atlanta metro area on Sunday morning. There were even one or two claps of thunder in Spalding county. Overall, the event generally produced 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accumulation, with isolated areas getting 1/2 to 1 inch of ice. The main problems seemed to be traffic accidents due to icy roads and bridges. There were scattered areas of trees and power lines down, but damage from this storm was nowhere as much as that from the storm the previous weekend.",,"PDC"

Additional rains sank south into western and central West Virginia during the afternoon of the 18th, reaching the Charleston to Sutton corridor around 1500E.   The southern edge of the rain lifted a bit further north during the early evening hours, temporarily ending the rain around Charleston and Huntington.

Seventeen of these bridges were damaged in Kanawha County, 16 in Calhoun County, and 12 in Braxton County.     A failed rescue along Kanawha Two Mile Creek, just outside the city limits of Charleston, resulted in 3 fatalities around 1845 to 1900E on the 18th.

Five employees of the gas station and small store were loaded into a zodiac raft by 2 firefighters, in an attempt to ferry them to safety.  The water was 2 to 3 feet around the gas station.  The raft overturned, spilling the occupants into the water.  None of the store employees were outfitted with floatation life jackets during the rescue attempt.

This prevented substantial accumulations from occurring and also stopped heavy snow from spreading farther northwest into the state.

Patchy light snow began in west central and northwest Georgia around daybreak on the 28th. There was a light dusting on the ground by mid morning from Troup to Carroll county, east to Fayette county. Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.  By Saturday morning, the 29th, temperatures had slowly fallen to near or just below the freezing mark over the north half of Georgia with a mix of light freezing drizzle, freezing rain, and sleet, with light snow in the mountains. The last batch of significant precipitation moved from Alabama into west central Georgia and on into the Atlanta metro area on Sunday morning. There were even one or two claps of thunder in Spalding county. Overall, the event generally produced 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accumulation, with isolated areas getting 1/2 to 1 inch of ice. The main problems seemed to be traffic accidents due to icy roads and bridges. There were scattered areas of trees and power lines down, but damage from this storm was nowhere as much as that from the storm the previous weekend.",,"PDC"

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water. Total Accumulations included (going from the northwest to southeast across the state): in Sussex County 15 inches in High Point, 14.7 inches in Culver Lake, 13.5 inches in  Wantage, 9.5 inches in Sparta and 8 inches in Sussex; in Warren County 12 inches in Phillipsburg and 11 inches in Allamuchy; in Morris County 12 inches in Oak Ridge, 11 inches in Long Valley, 9 inches in Whippany and Rockaway and 6 inches in Madison; in Hunterdon County 13 inches in White House Station, 11.5 inches in Califon and 10 inches in Flemington and Wertsville; in Somerset County 10.5 inches in Neshanic, 10 inches in Pottersville and 9 inches in Branchburg and Somerville, in Middlesex County 6 inches in New Brunswick and Woodbridge, in Monmouth County 7 inches in Ocean Grove and Manasquan, 6 inches in Howell and Union Beach; in Mercer County 10 inches in Washington's Crossing, 8 inches in Princeton and Hightstown; in Burlington County 13 inches in Moorestown, 10 inches in Lumberton and Marlton, 9 inches in Mount Laurel and 7 inches in Bordentown; in Ocean County 10 inches in Brick, 9 inches in Brant Beach and 8 inches in Jackson; in Camden County 14 inches in Gloucester City, 11 inches in Somerdale, 10 inches in Pennsauken and 8 inches in Cherry Hill; in Gloucester County 13 inches in Sewell and Mullica Hill, 11.5 inches in Swedesboro; in Salem County 10.3 inches in Deepwater; in Cumberland County 9 inches in Seabrook, 8 inches in Millville and 7 inches in Vineland; in Atlantic County 10 inches in Pomona, 9 inches in Estell Manor and 8.3 inches at the Atlantic City International Airport and in Cape May County 10 inches in North Wildwood, 8.5 inches in Cape May City and 8 inches in Cape May Courthouse. The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey.

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th.

The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

As the storm system matured, the dry slot swept out of the southern Plains into Illinois.  A deformation zone set up along the northwest edge of the dry slot with heavy snow setting up in a band from west central into northeast Iowa.  Snow fell at the rate of one to two inches an hour for a period of time.  Snowfall in the area was generally in the 6 to 9 inch range.  The heaviest snow fell in a band about 30 miles wide extending from near Boone, east-northeast to just south of Waterloo.  Numerous reports of 8.5 to 9 inches of snow were received from this area.  The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.  Damage was limited from the storm.  Though the snow was very wet and heavy, amounts were not great enough to cause major damage dow to loading.",,"PDC"

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water.

The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed.

The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.  Damage was limited from the storm.  Though the snow was very wet and heavy, amounts were not great enough to cause major damage dow to loading.",,"PDC"

Meanwhile, low pressure extended from southern Ohio on down the entire length of the Ohio River  during that afternoon.  A southerly wind at the surface, with dew points in the 55 to 60 degree range, fed moisture north from Tennessee and Kentucky.   This moisture was advected into the  boundary along the Ohio River.   Additional rains sank south into western and central West Virginia during the afternoon of the 18th, reaching the Charleston to Sutton corridor around 1500E.   The southern edge of the rain lifted a bit further north during the early evening hours, temporarily ending the rain around Charleston and Huntington.   Thunderstorms formed during the evening of the 18th, then pressed south again, as the low pressure passed just to the north of the affected area.  Rains diminished from west to east between 2000E on the 18th to 0400E on the 19th.  Rain amounts of 2 to 4 inches in 18 hours was common from a Huntington-Charleston-Elkins line on northwest .  An automated rain gauge near Beaver Run In Upshur County reported 4.6 inches.  In West Virginia, a total of 24 counties were under a state of emergency declared by Governor Underwood, 19 of which fell within this division of the state.  Later, on the 28th, President Clinton declared a federal disaster declaration for 20 counties, 17 of which are within this section of West Virginia.   The 17 counties included Barbour, Braxton, Cabell, Calhoun, Doddridge, Gilmer, Harrison, Jackson, Kanawha, Lewis, Mason, Putnam, Ritchie, Roane, Tyler, Upshur, and Wirt.   National Guard support reached a peak of about 250 troops in the flood clean-up efforts.  The preliminary damage assessment included 35 homes or mobile homes destroyed in the 17 counties.  A total of 350 home, mobile homes, and businesses sustained major damage.   Private bridges over the small streams were damaged.  Seventeen of these bridges were damaged in Kanawha County, 16 in Calhoun County, and 12 in Braxton County.     A failed rescue along Kanawha Two Mile Creek, just outside the city limits of Charleston, resulted in 3 fatalities around 1845 to 1900E on the 18th.  The incident occurred at a Rich Oil gas station along a flood prone section of Route 21.   Five employees of the gas station and small store were loaded into a zodiac raft by 2 firefighters, in an attempt to ferry them to safety.  The water was 2 to 3 feet around the gas station.  The raft overturned, spilling the occupants into the water.  None of the store employees were outfitted with floatation life jackets during the rescue attempt.  The body of a 53 year old woman was found in a nearby tree that night.  The body of a 52 year old man was discovered the next day in the stream.  The 56 year old female manager was not found until around 1300E on Sunday the 20th.  Her body had traveled some 140 miles, past 3 locks and dams, and was discovered in the Ohio River near Wheelersburg of Scioto County, Ohio.   A few days later, 2 teenage boys found her purse in a tree along Kanawha Two Mile.  The purse contained $6,000 from the store.    In this region of Kanawha County, Bonham and Tyler Mountain Elementary Schools received water damage.  In Ritchie County, most of the village of Cairo had been evacuated when flood waters rushed over the top of a temporary cofferdam, near North Bend State Park.

The community was completely cut off for 24 hours.  The sewage plants at Ellenboro and Cairo sustained damage.In Gilmer County, damage was from both small stream and river flooding.    In Roane County, the community of Reedy was hit hard, by the forks of Reedy Creek.  Water was higher than in March of 1997 and January of 1999.  A few homes had 1 to 2 feet of water in the living room.  Water made its way into the city building, the water-works office, the community center, the senior center, the post office, and the fire department.  Both stores in the community and the 3 churches were also affected by the high water.In Jackson County, the region around Sandyville, Liverpool, LeRoy, Lockhart, and Garfield were hardest hit.

Heavy snow began in southern and western sections of the state during the morning of the 27th, and gradually spread north and east. By the time the storm was over, 4 to 8 inches of snow had accumulated in about the northern half of the state and along the southern border.  In much of the southern half of the state, 8 to 14 inches of snow was common with isolated reports of 20 inches. It was the most widespead, heavy snow to affect Arkansas since 1988. Due to the snow, more than 600 chicken houses were damaged or destroyed, mostly in the southwest part of the state. Each house held up to 20,000 chickens, with the vast majority of chickens killed when the houses collapsed or because of hypothermia. Due to the loss of poultry, about two dozen counties were declared federal agricultural disaster areas. A hangar at the Benton Airport (Saline County) also collapsed. During the height of the storm, Interstate 30 became impassible from Malvern (Hot Spring County) to areas farther southwest, and was closed for a number of hours. The National Guard was called out to rescue stranded motorists, with a number of shelters opened for motorists and for the homeless. On the 29th, a State of Emergency was declared, with only necessary travel advised. There was one known fatality related to the storm.  A worker at a fast-food restaurant in Little Rock died of hypothermia on his way home. He was found in a local schoolyard near his destination.",,"PDC"

As the storm system matured, the dry slot swept out of the southern Plains into Illinois.  A deformation zone set up along the northwest edge of the dry slot with heavy snow setting up in a band from west central into northeast Iowa.  Snow fell at the rate of one to two inches an hour for a period of time.  Snowfall in the area was generally in the 6 to 9 inch range.  The heaviest snow fell in a band about 30 miles wide extending from near Boone, east-northeast to just south of Waterloo.  Numerous reports of 8.5 to 9 inches of snow were received from this area.  The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.

Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.  By Saturday morning, the 29th, temperatures had slowly fallen to near or just below the freezing mark over the north half of Georgia with a mix of light freezing drizzle, freezing rain, and sleet, with light snow in the mountains. The last batch of significant precipitation moved from Alabama into west central Georgia and on into the Atlanta metro area on Sunday morning. There were even one or two claps of thunder in Spalding county. Overall, the event generally produced 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accumulation, with isolated areas getting 1/2 to 1 inch of ice.

There was less cold air present at the start of the storm, especially along the coastal plain.  Most of it was in the lowest layers of the atmosphere. Precipitation started as snow in Cecil County, briefly as snow in Kent County and as sleet and freezing rain farther south along the Eastern Shore. After about an inch or two of snow, precipitation changed to freezing rain and sleet in Cecil County around 6 p.m. EST. Warm air was moving in from the nearby Atlantic and changed the freezing rain to plain rain. This took the longest near  the Chesapeake Bay and northwest Cecil County. By 10 p.m. EST all precipitation had changed to plain rain. By then about one-quarter to one third of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces.

The thunderstorms that were over southern Iowa moved northeast, with the precipitation changing over to snow in central  Iowa.  Bands of snow lifted northeast across the area through the night.  As the storm system matured, the dry slot swept out of the southern Plains into Illinois.  A deformation zone set up along the northwest edge of the dry slot with heavy snow setting up in a band from west central into northeast Iowa.  Snow fell at the rate of one to two inches an hour for a period of time.  Snowfall in the area was generally in the 6 to 9 inch range.  The heaviest snow fell in a band about 30 miles wide extending from near Boone, east-northeast to just south of Waterloo.  Numerous reports of 8.5 to 9 inches of snow were received from this area.  The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.  Damage was limited from the storm.  Though the snow was very wet and heavy, amounts were not great enough to cause major damage dow to loading.",,"PDC"

The snowfall became heavy early on the 25th with snowfall rates estimated at 4 inches per hour. A north-to-south oriented band of heavy snow remained in place over Moore, Lee, Wake, Franklin, Granville, Vance, and Warren counties for several hours. Snowfall amounts exceeded 20 inches in some locations in these counties. The western Piedmont counties recorded 8 to 12 inches of snow, while the Coastal Plain received 4 to 8 inches of snow with light icing at the end of the event. The heavy snow brought central North Carolina to a standstill. Many roads were impassable, and power outages were reported across the entire area. Statewide, an estimated 260,000 people were without power, mostly in the Sandhills. Strong, gusty winds produced snow drifts several feet high. At the Raleigh-Durham Airport, the record snowfall from one storm was set at 20.3 inches. The total cost of the storm to the state was estimated at $800 million.",,"PDC"

These orographically enhanced snows started in the afternoon of the 20th and continued through the afternoon of the 21st.  By the time the snow tapered to flurries across the area, storm totals of 3 to 6 inches were found across the eastern parts of Jefferson and Indiana Counties.  To the south, storm totals of between 4 and 8 inches were reported over the higher elevations of eastern Westmoreland and Fayette Counties, with up to a foot found over the highest ridges.  These strong northwest winds also produced windchills as cold as -30 F across the entire area during the event.",,"PDC"

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water.

The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

Thousands of homes were left without power due to ice covered tree limbs falling and snapping powerlines.  Also, hundreds of chicken houses were destroyed and several 7 million chicks were killed.  Barns, carports, and weak structure homes suffered collapse from the weight of the ice and snow.  Traffic accidents were numerous and I-30 west of Texarkana had to be shut down when the freeway became impassable.","PDC"

The snowfall became heavy early on the 25th with snowfall rates estimated at 4 inches per hour. A north-to-south oriented band of heavy snow remained in place over Moore, Lee, Wake, Franklin, Granville, Vance, and Warren counties for several hours. Snowfall amounts exceeded 20 inches in some locations in these counties. The western Piedmont counties recorded 8 to 12 inches of snow, while the Coastal Plain received 4 to 8 inches of snow with light icing at the end of the event. The heavy snow brought central North Carolina to a standstill. Many roads were impassable, and power outages were reported across the entire area. Statewide, an estimated 260,000 people were without power, mostly in the Sandhills. Strong, gusty winds produced snow drifts several feet high. At the Raleigh-Durham Airport, the record snowfall from one storm was set at 20.3 inches. The total cost of the storm to the state was estimated at $800 million.",,"PDC"

This led to the more typical potpourri of weather across Eastern Pennsylvania with primarily snow in the Poconos and a wintry mix farther south and east. Precipitation started during the afternoon as snow throughout the state.  By early evening precipitation had changed to sleet and freezing rain around the immediate Philadelphia area, but the transition away from snow was painfully slow farther north and west as heavy snow continued to fall. Around 9 p.m. EST enough warm air had moved into the local Philadelphia area to change the precipitation to plain rain. Meanwhile a transition to sleet with some freezing rain was occurring in the Lehigh Valley and Philadelphia's far northwestern suburbs. As the low pressure system made its closest pass to the area during the evening, colder air started to return on its west side and the sleet changed back to snow in both Pottstown (Montgomery County) and Allentown (Lehigh County) after 10 p.m. EST.  Precipitation ended from south to north from midnight through 3 a.m. EST on the 31st.  Temperatures never made it above freezing except for the local Philadelphia area. Accumulations were highest in the Poconos where precipitation fell as snow throughout the event. The greatest accretion of ice, around one-third of an inch, occurred in the local Philadelphia area.  Untreated roadways were very treacherous and high traffic volume due to Super Bowl Sunday exacerbated the problems.  Within Philadelphia there were numerous minor accidents. In hilly Manayunk bus routes were either cancelled or rerouted. Chester County emergency personnel responded to about 20 vehicular accidents. Snow emergencies were declared in 8 municipalities in Montgomery County. The accretion of ice, snow and sleet downed wires and caused power outages to 5,000 homes and businesses in Philadelphia's suburbs. In Monroe County the heavy snow forced the cancellation of schools on Monday the 31st.Snowfall accumulations included: in Carbon County 6 inches in Albrightsville; in Monroe County 11 inches in East Stroudsburg, 10.6 inches in Bossardsville and 9.5 inches in Pocono Summit.; in Berks County 7.5 inches in Mertztown, 7 inches in Blue Marsh Lake and Hamburg and 6 inches in Bechtelsville; in Lehigh County 7 inches in Fogelsville and 6 inches at the Lehigh Valley International Airport; in Northampton County 8 inches in Williams Township and 6.8 inches in Bath; in Chester County 5.6 inches in Glenmoore, 4 inches in West Chester and 3 inches in Downingtown; in Montgomery County 6 inches in Palm, 5.5 inches in Pottstown and 2 inches in Wynnewood; in Bucks County 7 inches in Springtown, 4 inches in Sellersville and 2.1 inches in Furlong and 2 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport.",,"PDC"

Especially hard hit have been the coffee crop in Kona and macadamia nuts islandwide on the Big Island of Hawaii, according to Wayne Nishijima, interim head of the Big Island cooperative extension service.  Also, water restrictions remain in effect for Niulii and Makapala in North Kohala, as does an outdoor burning ban imposed in 1998 for an area extending from Kau north through Kona to North and South Kohala.  Some ranching operations have been hurt by a lack of rainfall in parts of the Big Island as well.  For instance, none of January's precipitation reached Kahuku Ranch, one of the island's largest spreads, said ranch manager Earl Spence.  The last traceable rain was in December.",,"PDC"

Also, water restrictions remain in effect for Niulii and Makapala in North Kohala, as does an outdoor burning ban imposed in 1998 for an area extending from Kau north through Kona to North and South Kohala.  Some ranching operations have been hurt by a lack of rainfall in parts of the Big Island as well.  For instance, none of January's precipitation reached Kahuku Ranch, one of the island's largest spreads, said ranch manager Earl Spence.  The last traceable rain was in December.",,"PDC"

For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water. Total Accumulations included (going from the northwest to southeast across the state): in Sussex County 15 inches in High Point, 14.7 inches in Culver Lake, 13.5 inches in  Wantage, 9.5 inches in Sparta and 8 inches in Sussex; in Warren County 12 inches in Phillipsburg and 11 inches in Allamuchy; in Morris County 12 inches in Oak Ridge, 11 inches in Long Valley, 9 inches in Whippany and Rockaway and 6 inches in Madison; in Hunterdon County 13 inches in White House Station, 11.5 inches in Califon and 10 inches in Flemington and Wertsville; in Somerset County 10.5 inches in Neshanic, 10 inches in Pottersville and 9 inches in Branchburg and Somerville, in Middlesex County 6 inches in New Brunswick and Woodbridge, in Monmouth County 7 inches in Ocean Grove and Manasquan, 6 inches in Howell and Union Beach; in Mercer County 10 inches in Washington's Crossing, 8 inches in Princeton and Hightstown; in Burlington County 13 inches in Moorestown, 10 inches in Lumberton and Marlton, 9 inches in Mount Laurel and 7 inches in Bordentown; in Ocean County 10 inches in Brick, 9 inches in Brant Beach and 8 inches in Jackson; in Camden County 14 inches in Gloucester City, 11 inches in Somerdale, 10 inches in Pennsauken and 8 inches in Cherry Hill; in Gloucester County 13 inches in Sewell and Mullica Hill, 11.5 inches in Swedesboro; in Salem County 10.3 inches in Deepwater; in Cumberland County 9 inches in Seabrook, 8 inches in Millville and 7 inches in Vineland; in Atlantic County 10 inches in Pomona, 9 inches in Estell Manor and 8.3 inches at the Atlantic City International Airport and in Cape May County 10 inches in North Wildwood, 8.5 inches in Cape May City and 8 inches in Cape May Courthouse. The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

Dozens of public events were postponed. Both the Millville Airport and the Atlantic City International Airport were shut down. Many schools were also closed the next day (the 26th). Scores of vehicles slid off roadways. At least one man died of a heart attack after shoveling the snow. Strong onshore winds gusted up to 60 mph, downed power lines and caused about 3,100 homes and businesses to lose power. Motorists crashing into poles caused outages to another 1,100 homes and businesses in northern New Jersey. Service on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry was suspended. The rough onshore winds caused moderate tidal flooding at the time of the midday high tide on the 25th.  The snow began with a vengeance between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across the state.  It began in Cape May County and spread northwestward. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm.  By 6 a.m. EST, some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. After 6 a.m. EST, as warmer air came in above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's ""dry slot"" - an area of lighter precipitation.  Even so, mid morning accumulations of 5 inches were common along the New Jersey shore.  As colder air became more deeply entrenched across the state after 3 p.m. EST, the wintry mix started to change to sleet and then snow by the early evening of the 25th. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight EST on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region.  In Hoptacong (Sussex County), a pedestrian was injured by a vehicle. In Warren County, a tractor trailer jackknifed on Interstate 80 and backed up traffic in both directions for two hours. Interstates 78 and 287 became ""spinout alleys""  in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris Counties. In Middlesex County, a 35-year-old male was killed  on County Route 522 when he lost control of van and collided head-on with a tractor trailer. A four vehicle accident closed down busy New Jeresy State Route 18 during the evening rush hour. In Monmouth County on the 26th, a 58-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died after shoveling his car out in Upper Freehold Township.  In Gloucester County, a tractor trailer overturned in Harrison Township. In Atlantic County, two New Jersey Transit buses became stranded on the Atlantic City Expressway. One skidded onto a median and the other became stuck after stopping for assistance.  In Cumberland County,  many vehicles skidded off New Jersey State Route 55. About 4,200 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state. Most were along the shore as high winds took down power lines. In Middlesex County, the winds took down power lines on United States Route 1 in Edison. The worst wind damage occurred on the New Jersey State Route 72 Causeway between Long Beach Island and Stafford Township in Ocean County. The roadway was closed for 90 minutes around midday when two utility poles cracked and caused their wires to fall onto the westbound lanes. Downed wires caused outages to about 2,500 homes in Surf City. Other outages occurred on Mystic Islands. Another pole was knocked down on the mainland in Stafford Township.  The strong onshore winds also produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of the midday high tide on the 25th as well as some beach erosion. In Monmouth County coastal flooding was reported in Long Branch, Manasquan, Neptune and Union Beach.  In Atlantic County, there was a long list of bayside roads flooded from Brigantine to Somers Point. In Atlantic City, both the Black (U.S. Route 40 and 322) and White (U.S. Route 30) Horse Pikes were closed. The Beesleys Point Bridge connecting Somers Point and Upper Township (in Cape May County) was under 1.5 feet of water and closed. In Cape May County, flooding forced the closure of the 9th Street Bridge and Causeway in Ocean City. Flooding was also reported along 34th Street. Dozens of motorists were rescued from flooded streets. In Stratmere, the ocean met the bay as the oceanfront dunes collapsed.  In Wildwood, the New Jersey State Route 147 and the George Redding Bridges were closed. The worst flooding in Wildwood was on the west (bay) side of the township. North Wildwood declared a state of emergency because of the tidal flooding. The worst flooding was in the Angelsea section of North Wildwood. Three families near Delaware Avenue were evacuated.   In Cape May City minor tidal flooding was reported at the foot of Yacht and Washington Avenue and Elmira Street. The high tide at Sandy Hook peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1254 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at Atlantic City also peaked at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water at 1212 p.m. EST on the 25th. The high tide at the Cape May/Lewes Terminal peaked at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water at 1130 a.m. EST on the 25th and peaked at 8.5 feet above mean lower low water at 1201 p.m. EST on the 25th. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water. Total Accumulations included (going from the northwest to southeast across the state): in Sussex County 15 inches in High Point, 14.7 inches in Culver Lake, 13.5 inches in  Wantage, 9.5 inches in Sparta and 8 inches in Sussex; in Warren County 12 inches in Phillipsburg and 11 inches in Allamuchy; in Morris County 12 inches in Oak Ridge, 11 inches in Long Valley, 9 inches in Whippany and Rockaway and 6 inches in Madison; in Hunterdon County 13 inches in White House Station, 11.5 inches in Califon and 10 inches in Flemington and Wertsville; in Somerset County 10.5 inches in Neshanic, 10 inches in Pottersville and 9 inches in Branchburg and Somerville, in Middlesex County 6 inches in New Brunswick and Woodbridge, in Monmouth County 7 inches in Ocean Grove and Manasquan, 6 inches in Howell and Union Beach; in Mercer County 10 inches in Washington's Crossing, 8 inches in Princeton and Hightstown; in Burlington County 13 inches in Moorestown, 10 inches in Lumberton and Marlton, 9 inches in Mount Laurel and 7 inches in Bordentown; in Ocean County 10 inches in Brick, 9 inches in Brant Beach and 8 inches in Jackson; in Camden County 14 inches in Gloucester City, 11 inches in Somerdale, 10 inches in Pennsauken and 8 inches in Cherry Hill; in Gloucester County 13 inches in Sewell and Mullica Hill, 11.5 inches in Swedesboro; in Salem County 10.3 inches in Deepwater; in Cumberland County 9 inches in Seabrook, 8 inches in Millville and 7 inches in Vineland; in Atlantic County 10 inches in Pomona, 9 inches in Estell Manor and 8.3 inches at the Atlantic City International Airport and in Cape May County 10 inches in North Wildwood, 8.5 inches in Cape May City and 8 inches in Cape May Courthouse. The low pressure system responsible for the winter storm began as a weak low pressure system on a stationary front in southern Texas on the 23rd. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. Initial projections were for this storm system to stay far enough offshore for the heaviest precipitation to fall over the ocean and a more significant storm was expected on Wednesday the 26th. But, by Monday evening the 24th, it became apparent that the storm would not safely go out to sea.  In fact, it was intensifying and hugging the South Atlantic Coast. By 7 a.m. EST on the 25th, it was about a 980 millibar low just northeast of Cape Hatteras.  The storm's greatest intensification was over, but it moved northeast near the Atlantic Seaboard, instead of eastnortheast as was originally expected. At 7 p.m. EST, the storm was about a 975 millibar low located about 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It proceeded to move northeast and weaken and at 7 a.m. EST on the 26th, it was a 988 millibar low just east of Portland Maine. This storm system pushed the cold front well offshore. The third low that did develop on Wednesday the 26th was too far offshore to affect the region other than reinforcing the preexisting cold northwest flow.",,"PDC"

The thunderstorms that were over southern Iowa moved northeast, with the precipitation changing over to snow in central  Iowa.  Bands of snow lifted northeast across the area through the night.  As the storm system matured, the dry slot swept out of the southern Plains into Illinois.  A deformation zone set up along the northwest edge of the dry slot with heavy snow setting up in a band from west central into northeast Iowa.  Snow fell at the rate of one to two inches an hour for a period of time.  Snowfall in the area was generally in the 6 to 9 inch range.  The heaviest snow fell in a band about 30 miles wide extending from near Boone, east-northeast to just south of Waterloo.  Numerous reports of 8.5 to 9 inches of snow were received from this area.  The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.  Damage was limited from the storm.  Though the snow was very wet and heavy, amounts were not great enough to cause major damage dow to loading.",,"PDC"

Conectiv Energy had to dispatch crews to replace twenty poles that were knocked down by motorists.Accumulations included 6 inches in Montague and High Point (Sussex County), 5 inches in Jefferson Township (Morris County) and Wantage (Sussex County), 4 inches in Stanhope (Sussex County), Hackettstown (Warren County), White House Station (Hunterdon County), Rockaway (Morris County), and Neshanic (Somerset County), 3.9 inches in Califon (Hunterdon County), 3.5 inches in Hillsborough (Somerset County) and Trenton and Princeton (Mercer County), 3 inches in Atco (Camden County), Bordentown (Burlington County), Verga (Gloucester County) and Seabrook (Cumberland County), 2.8 inches in Estell Manor (Atlantic County) and Cherry Hill (Camden County), 2.5 inches in Milltown (Middlesex County) and Freehold (Monmouth County), 1.5 inches in Toms River (Ocean County), and 1 inch in Margate (Atlantic County) and Ocean City (Cape May County). The cause of the wintry weather were a pair of low pressure systems that developed in the Southern Plains during the day on the 17th. By Friday morning the 18th, one low was in the central Ohio Valley, the other near Springfield, Missouri. A large high pressure system moved across the northern Middle Atlantic States and New England on the 17th and 18th and supplied a fresh supply of cold air. The lows' storm track passed them across the extreme southeast part of New Jersey during the night of the 18th and the morning of the 19th. The proximity of these lows and the counterclockwise circulations around them from the nearby Atlantic Ocean were enough to raise temperatures above the freezing mark in central and southern New Jersey. But on a relative basis, these low pressure systems were weak.  While warmer air was able to move in aloft; the surface winds were not strong enough to either mix the warm air down or bring it into northwest New Jersey from the warmer Atlantic Ocean. The two low pressure systems also prolonged the precipitation event and it lasted around 24 hours.",,"PDC"

It slowly moved eastnortheast and by Sunday morning the 30th was located near Apalachicola Florida, not too far from the location of the January 25th storm. Unlike the previous storm, this one tracked farther to the west and moved northeast along the Atlantic Seaboard. By the morning of the 31st, it was located near Boston, Massachusetts. The farther westward storm track permitted warm air near the surface and aloft to move into Pennsylvania, particularly the Philadelphia area during the event. There was less cold air present at the start of the storm, especially nearer the coast.  Most of it was in the lowest layers of the atmosphere. This led to the more typical potpourri of weather across Eastern Pennsylvania with primarily snow in the Poconos and a wintry mix farther south and east. Precipitation started during the afternoon as snow throughout the state.  By early evening precipitation had changed to sleet and freezing rain around the immediate Philadelphia area, but the transition away from snow was painfully slow farther north and west as heavy snow continued to fall. Around 9 p.m. EST enough warm air had moved into the local Philadelphia area to change the precipitation to plain rain. Meanwhile a transition to sleet with some freezing rain was occurring in the Lehigh Valley and Philadelphia's far northwestern suburbs. As the low pressure system made its closest pass to the area during the evening, colder air started to return on its west side and the sleet changed back to snow in both Pottstown (Montgomery County) and Allentown (Lehigh County) after 10 p.m. EST.  Precipitation ended from south to north from midnight through 3 a.m. EST on the 31st.  Temperatures never made it above freezing except for the local Philadelphia area. Accumulations were highest in the Poconos where precipitation fell as snow throughout the event. The greatest accretion of ice, around one-third of an inch, occurred in the local Philadelphia area.  Untreated roadways were very treacherous and high traffic volume due to Super Bowl Sunday exacerbated the problems.  Within Philadelphia there were numerous minor accidents. In hilly Manayunk bus routes were either cancelled or rerouted. Chester County emergency personnel responded to about 20 vehicular accidents.
