Based on observations from the Grand Island ASOS (Central Nebraska Regional Airport), which reasonably represented conditions across the 24-county area as a whole, most of South Central Nebraska endured roughly five consecutive hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -40 degrees (F) or colder, around 30 consecutive hours of wind chills around -30 or colder (Warning criteria),  and around 42 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the -40 to -48 range, including airport ASOS readings as low as -48 at Ord, -45 in Hastings and -44 at Grand Island. Although some places (especially northern counties) faced similar to even slightly colder wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), especially southern parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, no official daily temperature records were set this time around per ASOS data at Grand Island/Hastings, with actual low temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska on the morning of the 22nd only bottoming out in the -10 to -20 range. As a result, these extreme wind chills were significantly driven by relentlessly strong north-northwest winds. During the entire 30-hour period that the Grand Island ASOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the evening of the 21st and the early morning of the 23rd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-40 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -15 to -20 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Grand Island ASOS data (generally representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole) the daily high temperature bottomed out at -5 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 9 degrees on the 23rd, 16 on the 24th and 41 on the 25th. In fact, less than a week after the brutal cold of the 22nd, highs soared to between the upper 40s-upper 50s on the 28th. ||Although the bitterly-cold wind chills were certainly the main weather story in South Central Nebraska between the 21st-24th, the early part of this time frame also featured one of the area's first semi-impactful winter precipitation events of the season. To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle, making roads at least somewhat slick. However, the main event transpired during the evening-overnight, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This main snow band first organized within northern/west-central counties mainly 8-10 PM and eventually exited far southeastern local counties mainly 2-4 AM. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Although falling snow moved out of South Central Nebraska before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south between the late afternoon and mid-evening of the 21st. During the day on the 22nd, the still strong (but slowly decreasing) winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient directed between a roughly 1011 millibar low centered over northeast AR/southeast MO (along the cold front) and a stout 1055 millibar high centered over MT.","Dangerously low wind chills occurred across the entire county.

This marked the 11th consecutive month that D2 plagued parts of the local area and the fifth straight month with at least limited coverage of D3. More specifically, roughly one-fourth of South Central Nebraska spent most of December in D3. Precipitation-wise, December was a mixed bag. On a positive note, the month was not as severely dry (versus normal) as the previous few months, and roughly one-fourth of the area actually measured at least slightly above normal precipitation (see below for more Dec. precipitation details). Focusing on county-level USDM drought category specifics during December, there was actually very little change within the 24 counties. The month opened with at least portions of 21 counties containing D2, with D2 blanketing the vast majority of real estate along/north of the Highway 6 corridor. In fact, only three of the southeastern-most local counties (Webster/Nuckolls/Thayer) began the month entirely void of D2...featuring a varied mix of Moderate Drought (D1) and Abnormally Dry (D0). On the worst-off side of things, fairly sizable portions of the following counties along/north of Interstate 80 opened the month in D3: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Howard, Nance (the entire county), Merrick, Polk, Dawson and Hall. To the south of I-80, D3 also nicked small slivers of far northwestern Gosper and far southwestern Furnas counties. As December wore on, the vast majority of the area featured no categorical change whatsoever. However, late in the month D3 expanded slightly to include a bit more of southern Furnas County. ||Turning to December 2022 precipitation details, although unfortunately around three-fourths of South Central Nebraska received at least slightly below normal totals, fortunately the month was not as severely dry as October-November were. The majority of the 24-county area totaled between 0.40-1.00 of precipitation, or 50-120 percent of normal. Although most places were officially below normal, there were far fewer severely-below-normal totals versus the previous few months, with roughly 85% of locations receiving at least half-normal. Geographically, there was a definite west-to-east disparity, with the overall-highest tallies focused within the western half of the area, and the overall-driest locations found in far eastern counties along the Highway 81 corridor. Per dozens of NWS and NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS observers, some of the very highest December totals featured: 1.74 nine miles northwest of Ord, 1.52 in Gothenburg, 1.41 at Riverdale and 1.37 near Rockville. On the noticeably drier side of things, some of the lowest totals from far eastern counties included: 0.19 in Bradshaw, 0.32 five miles northeast of Osceola, 0.34 near Gresham and 0.35 near Grafton.||Finishing with an overall recap of annual 2022 precipitation across South Central Nebraska, it was little surprise that drought took a significant turn for the worse. For many official long-term NWS stations, 2022 ranked between a Top-10 and Top-15 driest year on record. For many places, it was also the overall-driest year since at least 2012 or 2002, but in limited spots one has to go back much farther to find a drier year (for example, Hastings had its driest year in 56 years...since 1966!).

More specifically, roughly one-fourth of South Central Nebraska spent most of December in D3. Precipitation-wise, December was a mixed bag. On a positive note, the month was not as severely dry (versus normal) as the previous few months, and roughly one-fourth of the area actually measured at least slightly above normal precipitation (see below for more Dec. precipitation details). Focusing on county-level USDM drought category specifics during December, there was actually very little change within the 24 counties. The month opened with at least portions of 21 counties containing D2, with D2 blanketing the vast majority of real estate along/north of the Highway 6 corridor. In fact, only three of the southeastern-most local counties (Webster/Nuckolls/Thayer) began the month entirely void of D2...featuring a varied mix of Moderate Drought (D1) and Abnormally Dry (D0). On the worst-off side of things, fairly sizable portions of the following counties along/north of Interstate 80 opened the month in D3: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Howard, Nance (the entire county), Merrick, Polk, Dawson and Hall. To the south of I-80, D3 also nicked small slivers of far northwestern Gosper and far southwestern Furnas counties. As December wore on, the vast majority of the area featured no categorical change whatsoever. However, late in the month D3 expanded slightly to include a bit more of southern Furnas County. ||Turning to December 2022 precipitation details, although unfortunately around three-fourths of South Central Nebraska received at least slightly below normal totals, fortunately the month was not as severely dry as October-November were. The majority of the 24-county area totaled between 0.40-1.00 of precipitation, or 50-120 percent of normal. Although most places were officially below normal, there were far fewer severely-below-normal totals versus the previous few months, with roughly 85% of locations receiving at least half-normal. Geographically, there was a definite west-to-east disparity, with the overall-highest tallies focused within the western half of the area, and the overall-driest locations found in far eastern counties along the Highway 81 corridor. Per dozens of NWS and NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS observers, some of the very highest December totals featured: 1.74 nine miles northwest of Ord, 1.52 in Gothenburg, 1.41 at Riverdale and 1.37 near Rockville. On the noticeably drier side of things, some of the lowest totals from far eastern counties included: 0.19 in Bradshaw, 0.32 five miles northeast of Osceola, 0.34 near Gresham and 0.35 near Grafton.||Finishing with an overall recap of annual 2022 precipitation across South Central Nebraska, it was little surprise that drought took a significant turn for the worse. For many official long-term NWS stations, 2022 ranked between a Top-10 and Top-15 driest year on record. For many places, it was also the overall-driest year since at least 2012 or 2002, but in limited spots one has to go back much farther to find a drier year (for example, Hastings had its driest year in 56 years...since 1966!).

Based on observations from the Grand Island ASOS (Central Nebraska Regional Airport), which reasonably represented conditions across the 24-county area as a whole, most of South Central Nebraska endured roughly five consecutive hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -40 degrees (F) or colder, around 30 consecutive hours of wind chills around -30 or colder (Warning criteria),  and around 42 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the -40 to -48 range, including airport ASOS readings as low as -48 at Ord, -45 in Hastings and -44 at Grand Island. Although some places (especially northern counties) faced similar to even slightly colder wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), especially southern parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, no official daily temperature records were set this time around per ASOS data at Grand Island/Hastings, with actual low temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska on the morning of the 22nd only bottoming out in the -10 to -20 range. As a result, these extreme wind chills were significantly driven by relentlessly strong north-northwest winds. During the entire 30-hour period that the Grand Island ASOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the evening of the 21st and the early morning of the 23rd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-40 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -15 to -20 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Grand Island ASOS data (generally representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole) the daily high temperature bottomed out at -5 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 9 degrees on the 23rd, 16 on the 24th and 41 on the 25th. In fact, less than a week after the brutal cold of the 22nd, highs soared to between the upper 40s-upper 50s on the 28th. ||Although the bitterly-cold wind chills were certainly the main weather story in South Central Nebraska between the 21st-24th, the early part of this time frame also featured one of the area's first semi-impactful winter precipitation events of the season. To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle, making roads at least somewhat slick. However, the main event transpired during the evening-overnight, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This main snow band first organized within northern/west-central counties mainly 8-10 PM and eventually exited far southeastern local counties mainly 2-4 AM. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Although falling snow moved out of South Central Nebraska before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south between the late afternoon and mid-evening of the 21st. During the day on the 22nd, the still strong (but slowly decreasing) winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient directed between a roughly 1011 millibar low centered over northeast AR/southeast MO (along the cold front) and a stout 1055 millibar high centered over MT.","Dangerously low wind chills occurred across the entire county. The lowest measured wind chill was -48 degrees on the 22nd, recorded by the Ord Airport ASOS.","CSV"

Based on observations from the Grand Island ASOS (Central Nebraska Regional Airport), which reasonably represented conditions across the 24-county area as a whole, most of South Central Nebraska endured roughly five consecutive hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -40 degrees (F) or colder, around 30 consecutive hours of wind chills around -30 or colder (Warning criteria),  and around 42 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the -40 to -48 range, including airport ASOS readings as low as -48 at Ord, -45 in Hastings and -44 at Grand Island. Although some places (especially northern counties) faced similar to even slightly colder wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), especially southern parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, no official daily temperature records were set this time around per ASOS data at Grand Island/Hastings, with actual low temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska on the morning of the 22nd only bottoming out in the -10 to -20 range. As a result, these extreme wind chills were significantly driven by relentlessly strong north-northwest winds. During the entire 30-hour period that the Grand Island ASOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the evening of the 21st and the early morning of the 23rd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-40 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -15 to -20 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Grand Island ASOS data (generally representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole) the daily high temperature bottomed out at -5 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 9 degrees on the 23rd, 16 on the 24th and 41 on the 25th. In fact, less than a week after the brutal cold of the 22nd, highs soared to between the upper 40s-upper 50s on the 28th. ||Although the bitterly-cold wind chills were certainly the main weather story in South Central Nebraska between the 21st-24th, the early part of this time frame also featured one of the area's first semi-impactful winter precipitation events of the season. To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle, making roads at least somewhat slick. However, the main event transpired during the evening-overnight, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This main snow band first organized within northern/west-central counties mainly 8-10 PM and eventually exited far southeastern local counties mainly 2-4 AM. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Although falling snow moved out of South Central Nebraska before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south between the late afternoon and mid-evening of the 21st. During the day on the 22nd, the still strong (but slowly decreasing) winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient directed between a roughly 1011 millibar low centered over northeast AR/southeast MO (along the cold front) and a stout 1055 millibar high centered over MT.","Dangerously low wind chills occurred across the entire county. The lowest measured wind chill was -45 degrees on the 22nd, recorded by a Nebraska Mesonet station located two miles east of Smithfield.","CSV"

This marked the 11th consecutive month that D2 plagued parts of the local area and the fifth straight month with at least limited coverage of D3. More specifically, roughly one-fourth of South Central Nebraska spent most of December in D3. Precipitation-wise, December was a mixed bag. On a positive note, the month was not as severely dry (versus normal) as the previous few months, and roughly one-fourth of the area actually measured at least slightly above normal precipitation (see below for more Dec. precipitation details). Focusing on county-level USDM drought category specifics during December, there was actually very little change within the 24 counties. The month opened with at least portions of 21 counties containing D2, with D2 blanketing the vast majority of real estate along/north of the Highway 6 corridor. In fact, only three of the southeastern-most local counties (Webster/Nuckolls/Thayer) began the month entirely void of D2...featuring a varied mix of Moderate Drought (D1) and Abnormally Dry (D0). On the worst-off side of things, fairly sizable portions of the following counties along/north of Interstate 80 opened the month in D3: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Howard, Nance (the entire county), Merrick, Polk, Dawson and Hall. To the south of I-80, D3 also nicked small slivers of far northwestern Gosper and far southwestern Furnas counties. As December wore on, the vast majority of the area featured no categorical change whatsoever. However, late in the month D3 expanded slightly to include a bit more of southern Furnas County. ||Turning to December 2022 precipitation details, although unfortunately around three-fourths of South Central Nebraska received at least slightly below normal totals, fortunately the month was not as severely dry as October-November were. The majority of the 24-county area totaled between 0.40-1.00 of precipitation, or 50-120 percent of normal. Although most places were officially below normal, there were far fewer severely-below-normal totals versus the previous few months, with roughly 85% of locations receiving at least half-normal. Geographically, there was a definite west-to-east disparity, with the overall-highest tallies focused within the western half of the area, and the overall-driest locations found in far eastern counties along the Highway 81 corridor. Per dozens of NWS and NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS observers, some of the very highest December totals featured: 1.74 nine miles northwest of Ord, 1.52 in Gothenburg, 1.41 at Riverdale and 1.37 near Rockville. On the noticeably drier side of things, some of the lowest totals from far eastern counties included: 0.19 in Bradshaw, 0.32 five miles northeast of Osceola, 0.34 near Gresham and 0.35 near Grafton.||Finishing with an overall recap of annual 2022 precipitation across South Central Nebraska, it was little surprise that drought took a significant turn for the worse. For many official long-term NWS stations, 2022 ranked between a Top-10 and Top-15 driest year on record. For many places, it was also the overall-driest year since at least 2012 or 2002, but in limited spots one has to go back much farther to find a drier year (for example, Hastings had its driest year in 56 years...since 1966!). More specifically, most places fell between 5-12 short of 30-year normal precipitation (typically receiving no more than 55-80% of normal).  Based on data from dozens of NWS and NeRAIN/CoCoRaHS observers and also radar-estimated analysis, the very-driest conditions focused primarily within northern/western counties. The following counties were particularly dry (greatest concentration of annual totals under 15): most of Howard, Merrick, Nance...much of western Dawson...much of southwestern Furnas.

Based on observations from the AWOS at Smith Center Municipal Airport, which reasonably represented conditions across the area as a whole, most of North Central Kansas endured roughly 14 hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -30 degrees (F) or colder (Warning criteria) and around 40 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the  -35 to -40 range, including semi-official extremes as low as -40 at Smith Center Airport (AWOS), -39 near Jewell (KSU mesonet) and -38 near Phillipsburg (KSU mesonet). Although some places faced very similar wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), at least parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, actual low temperatures across most of North Central Kansas on the morning of the 22nd only bottomed out in the -10 to -15 range. As a result, the extreme wind chill values were significantly driven by relentless north-northwest winds. During the entire 14-hour period that the Smith Center AWOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the late evening of the 21st and the afternoon of the 22nd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-35 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -10 to -15 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Smith Center data (generally representative of North Central Kansas as a whole), the daily high temperatures bottomed out at -4 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 12 degrees on the 23rd, 26 on the 24th and 35 on the 25th. In fact, less than a week after the brutal cold of the 22nd, North Central Kansas highs soared into the 50s (and even isolated low 60s) on the 28th.||Although the bitterly-cold wind chills were certainly the main weather story in North Central Kansas between the 21st-24th, the early part of this time frame also featured one of the area's first semi-impactful winter precipitation events of the season. To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle. However, the main event transpired during the overnight hours, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This snow band mainly impacted the area between 11 PM and 5 AM before departing off to the south-southeast. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Though falling snow exited North Central Kansas before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south during the evening of the 21st. During the day on the 22nd, the still strong (but slowly decreasing) winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient directed between a roughly 1011 millibar low centered over northeast AR/southeast MO (along the cold front) and a stout 1055 millibar high centered over MT.","Dangerously low wind chills occurred across the entire county. The lowest measured wind chills occurred on the 22nd and included: -37 degrees, recorded by a Kansas State Mesonet station located in Osborne, and -35 degrees, recorded by a home mesonet station in Downs.","CSV"

During the entire 14-hour period that the Smith Center AWOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the late evening of the 21st and the afternoon of the 22nd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-35 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -10 to -15 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire.

However, the main event transpired during the overnight hours, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This snow band mainly impacted the area between 11 PM and 5 AM before departing off to the south-southeast. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Though falling snow exited North Central Kansas before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south during the evening of the 21st.

The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the -40 to -48 range, including airport ASOS readings as low as -48 at Ord, -45 in Hastings and -44 at Grand Island. Although some places (especially northern counties) faced similar to even slightly colder wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), especially southern parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, no official daily temperature records were set this time around per ASOS data at Grand Island/Hastings, with actual low temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska on the morning of the 22nd only bottoming out in the -10 to -20 range. As a result, these extreme wind chills were significantly driven by relentlessly strong north-northwest winds. During the entire 30-hour period that the Grand Island ASOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the evening of the 21st and the early morning of the 23rd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-40 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -15 to -20 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Grand Island ASOS data (generally representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole) the daily high temperature bottomed out at -5 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 9 degrees on the 23rd, 16 on the 24th and 41 on the 25th. In fact, less than a week after the brutal cold of the 22nd, highs soared to between the upper 40s-upper 50s on the 28th. ||Although the bitterly-cold wind chills were certainly the main weather story in South Central Nebraska between the 21st-24th, the early part of this time frame also featured one of the area's first semi-impactful winter precipitation events of the season. To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle, making roads at least somewhat slick. However, the main event transpired during the evening-overnight, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This main snow band first organized within northern/west-central counties mainly 8-10 PM and eventually exited far southeastern local counties mainly 2-4 AM. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Although falling snow moved out of South Central Nebraska before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south between the late afternoon and mid-evening of the 21st. During the day on the 22nd, the still strong (but slowly decreasing) winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient directed between a roughly 1011 millibar low centered over northeast AR/southeast MO (along the cold front) and a stout 1055 millibar high centered over MT.","Dangerously low wind chills occurred across the entire county.

Based on observations from the Grand Island ASOS (Central Nebraska Regional Airport), which reasonably represented conditions across the 24-county area as a whole, most of South Central Nebraska endured roughly five consecutive hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -40 degrees (F) or colder, around 30 consecutive hours of wind chills around -30 or colder (Warning criteria),  and around 42 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the -40 to -48 range, including airport ASOS readings as low as -48 at Ord, -45 in Hastings and -44 at Grand Island. Although some places (especially northern counties) faced similar to even slightly colder wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), especially southern parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, no official daily temperature records were set this time around per ASOS data at Grand Island/Hastings, with actual low temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska on the morning of the 22nd only bottoming out in the -10 to -20 range. As a result, these extreme wind chills were significantly driven by relentlessly strong north-northwest winds. During the entire 30-hour period that the Grand Island ASOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the evening of the 21st and the early morning of the 23rd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-40 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -15 to -20 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Grand Island ASOS data (generally representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole) the daily high temperature bottomed out at -5 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 9 degrees on the 23rd, 16 on the 24th and 41 on the 25th. In fact, less than a week after the brutal cold of the 22nd, highs soared to between the upper 40s-upper 50s on the 28th. ||Although the bitterly-cold wind chills were certainly the main weather story in South Central Nebraska between the 21st-24th, the early part of this time frame also featured one of the area's first semi-impactful winter precipitation events of the season. To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle, making roads at least somewhat slick. However, the main event transpired during the evening-overnight, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This main snow band first organized within northern/west-central counties mainly 8-10 PM and eventually exited far southeastern local counties mainly 2-4 AM. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Although falling snow moved out of South Central Nebraska before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute.

Flooding of streams, in low areas and from clogged storm drains also closed many other roads across Northern California, with several small communities being evacuated. Heavy snow also disrupted mountain travel, with multiple spinouts causing I-80 to be shut down for 18 hours. Highway 50 was closed in El Dorado County due to a combination of flooding and snow. High winds gusting 50-65 mph in the Central Valley caused large numbers of trees to fall, bringing widespread power failures across the area, with hundreds of thousands of customers impacted. Many local roads were closed to downed trees blocking them. Trees were also reported to have fallen on homes and automobiles. The storm with flooding continued into January, with several fatalities reported due to drowning and wind-downed trees.","Milton Road was closed for flooding.

Based on observations from the Grand Island ASOS (Central Nebraska Regional Airport), which reasonably represented conditions across the 24-county area as a whole, most of South Central Nebraska endured roughly five consecutive hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -40 degrees (F) or colder, around 30 consecutive hours of wind chills around -30 or colder (Warning criteria),  and around 42 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the -40 to -48 range, including airport ASOS readings as low as -48 at Ord, -45 in Hastings and -44 at Grand Island. Although some places (especially northern counties) faced similar to even slightly colder wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), especially southern parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, no official daily temperature records were set this time around per ASOS data at Grand Island/Hastings, with actual low temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska on the morning of the 22nd only bottoming out in the -10 to -20 range. As a result, these extreme wind chills were significantly driven by relentlessly strong north-northwest winds. During the entire 30-hour period that the Grand Island ASOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the evening of the 21st and the early morning of the 23rd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-40 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -15 to -20 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Grand Island ASOS data (generally representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole) the daily high temperature bottomed out at -5 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 9 degrees on the 23rd, 16 on the 24th and 41 on the 25th.

To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle, making roads at least somewhat slick. However, the main event transpired during the evening-overnight, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This main snow band first organized within northern/west-central counties mainly 8-10 PM and eventually exited far southeastern local counties mainly 2-4 AM.

Although falling snow moved out of South Central Nebraska before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute.

To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle. However, the main event transpired during the overnight hours, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This snow band mainly impacted the area between 11 PM and 5 AM before departing off to the south-southeast. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Though falling snow exited North Central Kansas before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south during the evening of the 21st. During the day on the 22nd, the still strong (but slowly decreasing) winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient directed between a roughly 1011 millibar low centered over northeast AR/southeast MO (along the cold front) and a stout 1055 millibar high centered over MT.","Dangerously low wind chills occurred across the entire county.

Based on observations from the AWOS at Smith Center Municipal Airport, which reasonably represented conditions across the area as a whole, most of North Central Kansas endured roughly 14 hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -30 degrees (F) or colder (Warning criteria) and around 40 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the  -35 to -40 range, including semi-official extremes as low as -40 at Smith Center Airport (AWOS), -39 near Jewell (KSU mesonet) and -38 near Phillipsburg (KSU mesonet).

As a result, the extreme wind chill values were significantly driven by relentless north-northwest winds.

Based on observations from the Grand Island ASOS (Central Nebraska Regional Airport), which reasonably represented conditions across the 24-county area as a whole, most of South Central Nebraska endured roughly five consecutive hours of extreme/rare wind chills around -40 degrees (F) or colder, around 30 consecutive hours of wind chills around -30 or colder (Warning criteria),  and around 42 straight hours of wind chills around -20 or colder (Advisory criteria). The absolute worst wind chills occurred on the morning of the 22nd, during which time nearly the entire area saw values plummet into the -40 to -48 range, including airport ASOS readings as low as -48 at Ord, -45 in Hastings and -44 at Grand Island. Although some places (especially northern counties) faced similar to even slightly colder wind chills less than two years prior (during the significant, more prolonged cold blast of mid-February 2021), especially southern parts of the area likely hadn't experienced wind chills this brutal in over 30 years...since the winter of 1989-90! Digging a bit deeper into the comparison between the sheer magnitude of the cold/wind chills between this Dec. 2022 Extreme Cold event and the aforementioned Feb. 2021 event, this one was certainly driven more by strong winds and less-so by extreme ambient air temperatures. In fact, no official daily temperature records were set this time around per ASOS data at Grand Island/Hastings, with actual low temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska on the morning of the 22nd only bottoming out in the -10 to -20 range. As a result, these extreme wind chills were significantly driven by relentlessly strong north-northwest winds. During the entire 30-hour period that the Grand Island ASOS observed wind chills of -30 or colder (centered between the evening of the 21st and the early morning of the 23rd), sustained speeds averaged 20-30 MPH, accompanied by frequent gusts at least 30-40 MPH. Although most of the area saw wind chills climb to slightly warmer than -20 by mid-day on the 23rd (due to the combination of slowly-rising temperatures and decreasing winds), at least sporadic wind chills as cold as -15 to -20 persisted from the night of the 23rd into the morning of the 24th, after which time the final Wind Chill Advisory was allowed to expire. Interestingly, this brief-but-intense cold blast was actually followed by a steady warm-up into and beyond Christmas itself. Again referencing Grand Island ASOS data (generally representative of South Central Nebraska as a whole) the daily high temperature bottomed out at -5 degrees on the 22nd, but then steadily recovered to 9 degrees on the 23rd, 16 on the 24th and 41 on the 25th. In fact, less than a week after the brutal cold of the 22nd, highs soared to between the upper 40s-upper 50s on the 28th. ||Although the bitterly-cold wind chills were certainly the main weather story in South Central Nebraska between the 21st-24th, the early part of this time frame also featured one of the area's first semi-impactful winter precipitation events of the season. To kick things off, much of the daylight hours on the 21st brought a light mix of snow/freezing drizzle, making roads at least somewhat slick. However, the main event transpired during the evening-overnight, as a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented band of moderate to briefly-heavy snow gradually marched across the area, developing slightly behind the leading edge of a powerful Arctic cold front. This main snow band first organized within northern/west-central counties mainly 8-10 PM and eventually exited far southeastern local counties mainly 2-4 AM. Although the heaviest snow only lasted around two hours at any given location, this was long enough to drop a widespread 1-2 (isolated slightly higher), with visibility commonly reduced to at least one-half mile at times thanks to strong north winds sustained 25-30 MPH/gusting up to around 45 MPH. Although falling snow moved out of South Central Nebraska before daybreak on the 22nd, the combination of residual blowing snow and the aforementioned extreme cold/wind chills made for a most unpleasant weather situation for the morning commute. Briefly touching on the meteorological background behind this Extreme Cold event, the aforementioned sharp Arctic front blasted through the area from north-to-south between the late afternoon and mid-evening of the 21st. During the day on the 22nd, the still strong (but slowly decreasing) winds were driven by a stout pressure gradient directed between a roughly 1011 millibar low centered over northeast AR/southeast MO (along the cold front) and a stout 1055 millibar high centered over MT.","Dangerously low wind chills occurred across the entire county.

A multicellular convective mode advanced in two waves with the first wave occurring through the morning hours in Southern MN, while the second wave produced a long-track supercell over the Twin Cities metro and Central Wisconsin. Both waves produced significant hail and damaging wind gusts. The synoptic setup included weak ridging and zonal flow in the Upper Midwest giving way to a deepening trough in the Pacific Northwest. A cold front was advancing eastward through the Dakotas. Over Iowa, a northward advancing warm front coupled with steep lapse rates in the mid levels (7.5-8��C/km) were able to drive development initially at the MN/IA border and eventually farther north into the Metro, then eastward. Upper-air soundings depicted a marginal environment for Supercell development with 50-60kt 0-6km shear and an elevated area of 1200 J/kg MUCAPE in the mid-levels. The SPC issued threat level for the day was slight to enhanced risk with most attention given to a significant hail potential. ||The storms that developed in the mid-late afternoon produced countless hailstones across the Twin Cities metro area, and into west central Wisconsin by the late afternoon. Beyond the typical 1 inch diameter hailstones, there were several hailstones up to 2 inches in diameter that fell over Washington County. A few other large hailstones fell over Le Sueur, Dakota and Goodhue Counties of southern Minnesota.","","CSV"

A small shed and a grain storage bin were also damaged, and a metal building system (MBS) structure had a large roll down door blown inward with part|of the back of the building blown out. The damage to the MBS building and the grain storage building were likely due to intense straight-line winds on the southern side of the tornadic circulation (rear flank downdraft).

Shortly before entering Idabel, the outer edge of this tornado hit the Oklahoma Mesonet observing platform located about 5 miles to the southwest off of Ravens Nest Road. An anemometer located 10 meters above the platform measured a wind gust of 108 mph, with a nearby single family home sustaining roof damage where EF-2 winds estimated near 125 mph removed a large section of the roof structure with a wall collapsing on another single family home off of Osprey Road. The tornado continued on to snap several hundred trees before hitting a single family home off of Boss Road which had a wall collapse and partial roof damage that could not be rated due to trees falling into the home. More EF-2 damage was observed as the tornado approached Highway 259 when the tornado removed the roof and much of the second story off of a single family home. The two people in the home took shelter on the first floor under the stairs, preventing injury as winds estimated at 125 mph damaged the home. As the tornado moved northeast across Stone Haven Road, a Davis weather station recorded a gust of approximately 130 mph. ||Upon entering Idabel, the tornado damaged additional roofs of homes in several neighborhoods on the southeast side of town. One of the most hard hit subdivisions was Country Club Estates. None of the homes in the Country Club Estates were rated due to tree damage which resulted in much of the structural damage from trees falling into homes. Nearby at the Idabel Country Club, nearly every tree sustained damage on approximately six holes, with mostly snaps observed. There was also some debarking of trees in this area, where an EF-3 swath of damage had begun. Behind the golf course, a single family home was destroyed with most of its walls collapsed except for a small interior room. ||The tornado continued to move northeast, hitting the Kiamichi Family Medical Center where EF-2 damage (near 115 mph) was estimated due to the facade components that were torn from the structure. As the tornado approached Highway 259 and East Washington Street, it damaged the sign of a McDonald's and a swath of EF-3 winds completely destroyed the Donut Crossing and Express Tire stores. A sign from the Donut Crossing store was lofted by the tornado and carried 14.3 miles where it was found on the west side of Eagletown. After crossing East Washington Street, the tornado completely destroyed the Trinity Baptist Church. Winds at this location were estimated to be near 155 mph with the total destruction of the metal building system which was surrounded by a brick wall that collapsed with concrete anchors pulled up from the ground. The tornado moved on to produce narrow EF-2 damage in the more broader EF-1 damage swath with small vorticies likely extending down to the ground from the elevated large funnel cloud at this point. ||After moving northeast of Idabel, the tornado crossed mainly rural areas and completely destroyed chicken houses while snapping hardwood and softwood trees for approximately the next ten miles. An areal survey indicates that the tornado briefly lifted near the Little River and then touched down again in a forested area before damaging a metal structure atop a chicken plant off of Craig Road. A survey team from the National Weather Service Little Rock office found EF-2 damage with 135 mph winds between Eagletown and Broken Bow just south of Highway 70, where numerous trees and several wooden utility poles were snapped near the base near the Tyson Craig Feed Mill, a large elevator structure on top of a silo collapsed with a portion of a metal roof and walls ripped off of an adjacent metal building, and a doublewide manufactured home at the eastern end of Box Turtle Road was thrown off of its concrete pad, nearly pulling out an underground shelter, rolling over it, and landing about 30 feet to the north. Over half of the house was stripped of the undercarriage. Only about one-third of the walls/roof were left with the remainder of the structure removed and scattered well to the north. ||As the tornado crossed Highway 70 just west of Eagletown, many additional pines and hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. Nearly all utility poles within the path were also snapped or pushed over. The tornado then moved into a heavily forested area north of Eagletown with more specific damage noted from Old Winship Road to Pero Creek through the use of high-resolution satellite imagery before the tornado finally lifted a few miles before reaching the border with Northwestern Sevier County in Southwest Arkansas. ||Remarkedly, only 6 injuries and no fatalities were reported from this long track tornado throughout Southern and Eastern McCurtain County Oklahoma. In total, 220 homes were estimated to had been affected by this tornado, with 10-20 businesses damaged or destroyed. Of the total homes affected, 65 of them were destroyed.","CSV"

These storms developed within a strongly unstable environment, featuring MLCAPE values ranging from 2500 to as much as 4000 J/kg and largely driven by the very warm and humid boundary layer. The initial round of storms struggled to become organized. Eventually cold pool interactions drove upscale growth into a more linear complex. Damaging winds, occasional large hail were reported as well as bursts of very heavy rain rates. By the evening of August 3rd, storms grew upscale, with additional rounds of thunderstorms developing upstream from this initial activity. The primary hazard transitioned from a damaging wind threat to a heavy rain and flash flooding threat, as storms were extremely efficient rain producers. Warm cloud depths were around 4.5km, along with anomalously high precipitable water values of 2 to 2.5 inches, and Corfidi vector orientations that supported westward back-building which enhanced the potential for locally heavy rain, both in terms of instantaneous rates (2+ inches per hour at times) and training of storms. By mid morning on August 4th, widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches fell, mainly along and south of I-70 in Missouri and along and east of I-55 in Illinois. Over the St. Louis metro area, as well as Fredericktown, MO, between 4 and 7 inches of rain fell. There were numerous reports of flash flooding in these areas.","Up to 3.5 inches of rain fell in a short amount of time across the northern portions of Monroe County causing flash flooding. Numerous roads were flooded.","CSV"

Large scale forcing increased along the dry line across Central Texas during the late afternoon through the evening, as these storms tapped moderate instability and increasing wind shear ahead of this system. In fact, isolated showers and a few thunderstorms developed during the mid and late afternoon across portions of Northeast Louisiana, with one storm spawning a brief tornado over Northeast Ouachita Parish near the Swartz community. These storms over Central Texas eventually developed in a quasi-linear convection system (QLCS), as they became severe and accelerated east across much of East Texas and North Louisiana during the evening through the early morning hours of the 12th-13th. Instances of damaging winds were reported from these storms, downing numerous trees and power lines, and even spawning isolated tornadoes as well. While these storms exited the region prior to daybreak on the 13th, additional showers and thunderstorms developed along the associated cold front across East Texas during the mid and late morning of the 13th, before spreading into North Louisiana during the peak heating of the afternoon. Thus, adequate instability developed such that some of these storms again became severe, producing instances of damaging winds over portions of North Louisiana and an isolated tornado over Eastern Winn/Western Caldwell Parishes.

Brisk north/northeasterly surface winds were across the Upper Midwest with an increasing area of (850-700 MB) low-level forcing preceding an upper trough over the northern Rockies. These two elements aided in the development of a narrow band of moderate to heavy snowfall that was first centered along the North Dakota, South Dakota border Sunday evening. Regional radar that evening showed an enhanced area of higher reflectivity that slowly spread eastward across central Minnesota late Sunday night, and into Monday morning before lifting northeast over the arrowhead of Minnesota. ||Snowfall rates of 1  to 2 inches per hour were noted over central Minnesota early Monday morning as modest forcing within the dendritic growth layer supported these type of rates.  By Monday afternoon, most of the snowfall tapered off to flurries or light snow will little additional accumulation until Monday night. ||A secondary wave developed across the central plains late Monday night. It was much |stronger than the previous wave and had more moisture surging northward into the system. Another area of light snow that affected central Minnesota Tuesday morning was broader but less intense. Although additional snow fell during this time period, the heaviest occurred during the first wave late Sunday night, and into Monday morning. ||Total snowfall amounts by Tuesday evening, led to a broad area of 6 to 14 inches of snow that fell from Morris, east-northeast to Sauk Centre, Rice, Princeton, and Rush City northward.

Heavy snow fell during the morning, with up to 7 inches prior to 8 AM, Monday morning. There was a lull in the precipitation Monday afternoon and evening before a second wave of light to moderate snow fell across the county.

Initial damage was a combination of downed or damaged trees along with several homes having minor to moderate roof damage from shingle loss. One home had a large tree through it. Intensity increased quickly as the tornado crossed Johnson Street and moved into the area of Tallulah Academy and the ballpark. The school took a direct hit with a large section of the roof taken off and some peeled back. While the outer walls remained intact, damage was noted on the eastern side of the building. Along Wood Street, several mobile homes were damaged with one heavily damaged from being pushed off the blocks. Other homes on the south side of the street sustained various degrees of roof damage along with downed power lines.

The tornado downed a tree on a manufactured home as it crossed US 49, then producing minor roof damage to houses along Castle Chapel Road and damaging some outbuildings. Similar damage persisted as the tornado continued northeastward across Fletchers Chapel Road, Myrtleville Road, and Cox Road, with a church sustaining roof damage. The tornado continued|snapping and uprooting numerous trees as it moved into the Benton area, crossing Rusche Road and Harris Road where a couple of small homes sustained roof damage and the roof of a small barn was removed. The tornado reached its greatest intensity as it crossed MS Highway 16 just west of Redbud Drive with significant snapping of trees. Several homes experienced mostly minor roof damage in the neighborhood along Redbud Drive just east of this location. The tornado skirted the west side of Benton, lifting northeastward along Niven Road and Stubblefield Road. Along Johnston Road, the tornado crossed the damage path of a previous EF-1 tornado that occurred just a week prior on Tuesday, March 22nd. The tornado strengthened again as it reached the|intersection of Johnston Road and Chew Forks Road. Along with tree damage again becoming more substantial in this area, a shed was destroyed and other outbuildings in the area were damaged.

Rainfall rates of 2.22 inches per hour were observed during the peak of the storm in Markleeville, CA which corresponds to at least a 500 year recurrence interval and possibly 1000 year, per NOAA 14 atlas.","Mesonet station (MKEC1) located in Markleeville, CA, reported heavy rain total of 1.82 inches. Utility Mesonet sensor also located in Markleeville, CA, reported 2.49 inches in 90 minutes and 2.22 inches in 60 minutes.","CSV"
