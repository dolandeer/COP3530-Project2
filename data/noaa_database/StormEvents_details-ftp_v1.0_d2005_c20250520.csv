Only Cape May County and coastal Atlantic County were spared heavy accumulations. In northern and southwestern New Jersey accumulations ranged from 8 to 17 inches with the highest amounts in Ocean, Burlington, Monmouth and Middlesex Counties. Across southeastern New Jersey accumulations ranged from around 10 inches in interior Atlantic and Cumberland Counties to less than an inch along coastal Cape May County. Seventeen of the twenty-one New Jersey counties reported at least one measurement of a foot or greater of snow. Governor Richard Codey declared a state of emergency from 8 p.m. EST on the 22nd through 8 a.m. EST on the 23rd. Vehicles were required to stay off of public roads and thoroughfares. Snow began falling during the late morning of the 22nd, fell at its heaviest during the second half of the afternoon and early part of the evening of the 22nd. Snow mixed with sleet over interior sections of Atlantic County, in Cumberland County and in southern Ocean County. By the time the heavier precipitation arrived in extreme southeast New Jersey, enough of an onshore flow changed the snow to rain. The snow ended during the morning of the 23rd. Gusty northwest winds which followed in the wake of the storm caused considerable drifting snow and hampered road crews efforts as drifts continued to form on roads through the night of the 23rd. The unseasonably cold weather also rendered the salt less effective. Many of the reported accidents were minor. Some municipalities were reporting more sledding than vehicular accidents. Strong winds in Monmouth and Ocean Counties caused downed tree limbs and wires and caused about 15,000 homes and businesses to lose power. Many sporting, community events and church services were cancelled. Museums and malls closed early on the 22nd and many opened late on the 23rd. Even Rutgers University cancelled classes on the 22nd and 23rd. Prior to the snow's arrival many supermarkets and video stores were reporting record sales. Snow emergencies were declared by many municipalities. A Hopatcong (Morris County) man died shoveling snow. A pedestrian was struck and killed by a snow plow in Mercer County.  Many schools were closed on the 24th. The remainder that opened had delayed openings. Regional rail lines reported delays from the 22nd through the 24th. For the first time in 9 years, nearby Philadelphia International Airport was closed for about 5 hours on the 22nd. Eight hundred passengers were stranded.

This type of low rarely produce snowfalls of this intensity. This low moved southeast from eastern Montana on the morning of the 21st to southern Minnesota on the evening of the 21st to near Dayton, Ohio around sunrise on the 22nd. It then moved to just south of Erie, Pennsylvania on the afternoon of the 22nd. A secondary low pressure system formed over the lower Chesapeake Bay on the afternoon of the 22nd.

Lowland flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County.  The White River in southern Indiana rose to bankfull levels.  This was the result of the melting snow cover.With warm air over Indiana, a storm system brought 2 to 4 inches of rain to much of central and southern Indiana from the 1st through the 3rd.  Because of the saturated soil conditions, widespread local flooding occurred in central and southern Indiana.  The major rivers in the state were flooding by the 4th. Another storm system quickly followed from the 4th through the 6th. This storm system tracked across southern Indiana and brought 2 to possibly 5 inches of rain to central and southern Indiana.  Because much of this rain fell as freezing rain just north of Indianapolis, two very significant weather events occurred; a major ice storm and flood.Major flooding resulted along the White, East Fork White and Wabash River in southern Indiana.  Flood levels that had not been seen in 40, 50 or more than 90 years occurred just south of the Indianapolis area.  New record stages were set at the White River at Edwardsport and the Wabash River at Mount Carmel.  The White River at Hazleton approached its record stage.Flooding in southern Indiana was much worse than the January 1991 flood.  Areas affected in the January 1991 flood were affected again and more severely.  These included Shelbyville, Rushville, Seymour, Wheeler Hollow, Bedford, Shoals, Spencer, Elnora, Edwardsport, Petersburg area, Hazleton, East Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Numerous state roads and local roads flooded by several feet.  Many local agricultural levees were overtopped.As this flood unfolded, cold air behind this storm system shut off the rain but left several inches of snow covering central and northern Indiana on the 7th and 8th.  Flooding fighting in southern Indiana occurred during rather harsh January conditions from the 7th through the 10th.  Milder conditions returned on the 11th.Some of the significant events during this flood include:Columbus, a large city in southern Indiana, had only one access road to I-65 causing long traffic delays.   Sandbagging efforts to save a power substation that served much of Rushville.A flood fight in Shelbyville to keep the Big Blue River from portions of the town.At least 70% of Jackson County was flooded.  Evacuations occurred in Rockford, Shields and Brownstown area.A levee failed along the Eel River in the Jasonville area.  Flood waters rose to within 10 inches of a power box for the Jasonville water system.  Power was shut down and the town lost its water until flood levels receded.Spencer lost wastewater treatment service.  This closed nearly all the restaurants in town.  Flood waters were within 2 ½ blocks of the Owen county courthouse.Flood waters at the Columbus wastewater treatment plant reached so high that employees were evacuated.  The plant was operated by the automated system for 12 hours.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard waged a major flood fight to save the Hazleton levee that protected nearly ½ of the town.  At times the levee partially failed but was reinforced.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard sandbagged at State Road 64 to protect East Mount Carmel, Indiana.  Sandbagging occurred on the Illinois side near Rochester.Potential major problems at the Edwardsport Power Plant on the White River were averted.Coal shipment to a major power plant in Gibson County was threatened by high levels on the Wabash River.  The situation was monitored closely.Local Sandbagging in the Elnora area saved several homes.While major flooding was spreading throughout southern Indiana, central Indiana experienced extensive flooding on the White River from Muncie through Indianapolis and the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Sandbagging was necessary in Anderson and Ravenswood areas.   The warmer temperatures on the 11th began to melt the snow and ice that covered central and northern Indiana.  An additional 1 to 4 inches of rain fell in much of central Indiana late on the 11th.  This caused flash flooding in portions of Delaware, Madison, Tipton and Howard Counties.  The most serious flooding was in the towns of Alexandria and Kokomo.  Significant flooding occurred in Albany and Eaton.  Flooding returned to the White River in central Indiana as a result of the rain on the 11th.   After reaching a crest, the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes began to rise again.  January 12 was the warmest and one of the driest days in the New Year.  Temperatures in central and southern Indiana soared into the 60s.  Mild conditions were short lived.As cold air pushed through Indiana on the 13th, an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain fell in central and southern Indiana.  This rain caused widespread local flooding.  Major flooding developed along the White River in Hamilton and northern Marion Counties.  Flood levels approached those of January 1991 in this area.  Evacuations occurred in the Ravenswood area.  Some homes had their power turned off because of high water levels.Major flooding developed on the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes as a result of the rain on the 13th.  Flood levels in the Lafayette and Covington areas reached their highest levels since July 2003.  Flooding from Montezuma to near Vincennes was the highest since June 1958.As this major flood crest was moving downstream along the Wabash River, flood fighting occurred under very brutal conditions.  Temperatures fell below freezing late on the 14th.  Snow of 1 to 4 inches fell in much of eastern Illinois and central Indiana on the 16th.  Temperatures dropped below zero on the 17th and 18th in the Hutsonville and Vincennes areas.  Temperature moderated to more normal levels by 19th.Areas along the Wabash River most severely flooded included, Montezuma, Clinton, Taylorville and Riverview in Indiana and Darwin, York, and Hutsonville in Illinois.  Flood waters overtopped many local agricultural levels.  Flood waters affected the cemetery at Palestine, Illinois. As the Wabash River approached record levels at Hutsonville, the Island Creek levee across from the Hutsonville Power Plant failed during the late evening on the 17th.  The level of the Wabash River fell 5 inches immediately in the town of Hutsonville.  Daylight revealed the levee breach was 300 to 500 feet wide and covered 5,000 acres of farmland with 7 to 8 feet of flood waters.  This breach damaged State Road 154 between Hutsonville and Grayville.  Now a short 5 mile drive for local residents was a 70 mile one way journey. The breach of the Island Creek levee caused the Wabash River to crest immediately at Hutsonville and very soon afterwards at Riverton.  The river crested at Vincennes within a day after the levee failure.  Water flowing back into the river from the area protected by the Island Creek levee caused another crest at Riverton and Vincennes.  This level was slightly lower than the crest after the breach.Rain on the 11th and 13th fell as the rivers were near crest in the Petersburg, Hazleton and Mount Carmel areas.  The combination of rain and very cold temperatures hindered flood fighting in these areas.  By the 13th the rivers crested at Petersburg, Hazleton, Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Flood waters would continue to recede for the remainder of January, although at times very slowly. The flood crest at New Harmony was the highest since January 1950.Another crest followed the major flood that had occurred along the White and East Fork White Rivers in much of southern Indiana.  This crest was 2 to 3 feet lower on the White River from Centerton to Edwardsport.  On the East Fork White River this crest was more than 8 feet lower in the Columbus and Bedford areas and 1 ½ feet lower at Seymour.  These crests washed out as they approached Petersburg.  The great flood of January 2005 began to wind down at all locations on the 20th.  Mother Nature had thrown every type of severe winter weather at the residents in the Wabash River Valley. Upwards of 30 inches of snow and 12 inches of water had fallen during the prior 30 days.By the end of January flooding had ended everywhere in the Wabash River Valley except for lowland flooding along portions of the Wabash River.  Millions of dollars in flood damage had occurred since the beginning of winter.  The great flood of January 2005 was the most extensive in areal coverage for Indiana since March 1913 and possibly unprecedented.  At least 4,000 homes and businesses flooded and more than 7,000 people displaced.  One person died while attempting to cross the extensively flooded Wabash River in Warren County.Crests on the major rivers in central Indiana were as high as 15.5 feet above flood stage.","A man attempted to cross a bridge over the swollen Wabash River and was swept to his death.  It was after dark, and water was over the road approaching the bridge.  It is believed that the man crawled through the car window in an attempt to get to safety and was swept away by the strong current.  The search was called off on 12 January to wait until the waters receded, due to the hazardous nature of the search.","PDS"

Lowland flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County.  The White River in southern Indiana rose to bankfull levels.  This was the result of the melting snow cover.With warm air over Indiana, a storm system brought 2 to 4 inches of rain to much of central and southern Indiana from the 1st through the 3rd.  Because of the saturated soil conditions, widespread local flooding occurred in central and southern Indiana.  The major rivers in the state were flooding by the 4th. Another storm system quickly followed from the 4th through the 6th. This storm system tracked across southern Indiana and brought 2 to possibly 5 inches of rain to central and southern Indiana.  Because much of this rain fell as freezing rain just north of Indianapolis, two very significant weather events occurred; a major ice storm and flood.Major flooding resulted along the White, East Fork White and Wabash River in southern Indiana.  Flood levels that had not been seen in 40, 50 or more than 90 years occurred just south of the Indianapolis area.  New record stages were set at the White River at Edwardsport and the Wabash River at Mount Carmel.  The White River at Hazleton approached its record stage.Flooding in southern Indiana was much worse than the January 1991 flood.  Areas affected in the January 1991 flood were affected again and more severely.  These included Shelbyville, Rushville, Seymour, Wheeler Hollow, Bedford, Shoals, Spencer, Elnora, Edwardsport, Petersburg area, Hazleton, East Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Numerous state roads and local roads flooded by several feet.  Many local agricultural levees were overtopped.As this flood unfolded, cold air behind this storm system shut off the rain but left several inches of snow covering central and northern Indiana on the 7th and 8th.  Flooding fighting in southern Indiana occurred during rather harsh January conditions from the 7th through the 10th.  Milder conditions returned on the 11th.Some of the significant events during this flood include:Columbus, a large city in southern Indiana, had only one access road to I-65 causing long traffic delays.   Sandbagging efforts to save a power substation that served much of Rushville.A flood fight in Shelbyville to keep the Big Blue River from portions of the town.At least 70% of Jackson County was flooded.  Evacuations occurred in Rockford, Shields and Brownstown area.A levee failed along the Eel River in the Jasonville area.  Flood waters rose to within 10 inches of a power box for the Jasonville water system.  Power was shut down and the town lost its water until flood levels receded.Spencer lost wastewater treatment service.  This closed nearly all the restaurants in town.  Flood waters were within 2 ½ blocks of the Owen county courthouse.Flood waters at the Columbus wastewater treatment plant reached so high that employees were evacuated.  The plant was operated by the automated system for 12 hours.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard waged a major flood fight to save the Hazleton levee that protected nearly ½ of the town.  At times the levee partially failed but was reinforced.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard sandbagged at State Road 64 to protect East Mount Carmel, Indiana.  Sandbagging occurred on the Illinois side near Rochester.Potential major problems at the Edwardsport Power Plant on the White River were averted.Coal shipment to a major power plant in Gibson County was threatened by high levels on the Wabash River.  The situation was monitored closely.Local Sandbagging in the Elnora area saved several homes.While major flooding was spreading throughout southern Indiana, central Indiana experienced extensive flooding on the White River from Muncie through Indianapolis and the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Sandbagging was necessary in Anderson and Ravenswood areas.   The warmer temperatures on the 11th began to melt the snow and ice that covered central and northern Indiana.  An additional 1 to 4 inches of rain fell in much of central Indiana late on the 11th.  This caused flash flooding in portions of Delaware, Madison, Tipton and Howard Counties.  The most serious flooding was in the towns of Alexandria and Kokomo.  Significant flooding occurred in Albany and Eaton.  Flooding returned to the White River in central Indiana as a result of the rain on the 11th.   After reaching a crest, the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes began to rise again.  January 12 was the warmest and one of the driest days in the New Year.  Temperatures in central and southern Indiana soared into the 60s.  Mild conditions were short lived.As cold air pushed through Indiana on the 13th, an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain fell in central and southern Indiana.  This rain caused widespread local flooding.  Major flooding developed along the White River in Hamilton and northern Marion Counties.  Flood levels approached those of January 1991 in this area.  Evacuations occurred in the Ravenswood area.  Some homes had their power turned off because of high water levels.Major flooding developed on the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes as a result of the rain on the 13th.  Flood levels in the Lafayette and Covington areas reached their highest levels since July 2003.  Flooding from Montezuma to near Vincennes was the highest since June 1958.As this major flood crest was moving downstream along the Wabash River, flood fighting occurred under very brutal conditions.  Temperatures fell below freezing late on the 14th.  Snow of 1 to 4 inches fell in much of eastern Illinois and central Indiana on the 16th.  Temperatures dropped below zero on the 17th and 18th in the Hutsonville and Vincennes areas.  Temperature moderated to more normal levels by 19th.Areas along the Wabash River most severely flooded included, Montezuma, Clinton, Taylorville and Riverview in Indiana and Darwin, York, and Hutsonville in Illinois.  Flood waters overtopped many local agricultural levels.  Flood waters affected the cemetery at Palestine, Illinois. As the Wabash River approached record levels at Hutsonville, the Island Creek levee across from the Hutsonville Power Plant failed during the late evening on the 17th.  The level of the Wabash River fell 5 inches immediately in the town of Hutsonville.  Daylight revealed the levee breach was 300 to 500 feet wide and covered 5,000 acres of farmland with 7 to 8 feet of flood waters.  This breach damaged State Road 154 between Hutsonville and Grayville.  Now a short 5 mile drive for local residents was a 70 mile one way journey. The breach of the Island Creek levee caused the Wabash River to crest immediately at Hutsonville and very soon afterwards at Riverton.  The river crested at Vincennes within a day after the levee failure.  Water flowing back into the river from the area protected by the Island Creek levee caused another crest at Riverton and Vincennes.  This level was slightly lower than the crest after the breach.Rain on the 11th and 13th fell as the rivers were near crest in the Petersburg, Hazleton and Mount Carmel areas.  The combination of rain and very cold temperatures hindered flood fighting in these areas.  By the 13th the rivers crested at Petersburg, Hazleton, Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Flood waters would continue to recede for the remainder of January, although at times very slowly. The flood crest at New Harmony was the highest since January 1950.Another crest followed the major flood that had occurred along the White and East Fork White Rivers in much of southern Indiana.  This crest was 2 to 3 feet lower on the White River from Centerton to Edwardsport.  On the East Fork White River this crest was more than 8 feet lower in the Columbus and Bedford areas and 1 ½ feet lower at Seymour.  These crests washed out as they approached Petersburg.  The great flood of January 2005 began to wind down at all locations on the 20th.  Mother Nature had thrown every type of severe winter weather at the residents in the Wabash River Valley. Upwards of 30 inches of snow and 12 inches of water had fallen during the prior 30 days.By the end of January flooding had ended everywhere in the Wabash River Valley except for lowland flooding along portions of the Wabash River.  Millions of dollars in flood damage had occurred since the beginning of winter.  The great flood of January 2005 was the most extensive in areal coverage for Indiana since March 1913 and possibly unprecedented.  At least 4,000 homes and businesses flooded and more than 7,000 people displaced.  One person died while attempting to cross the extensively flooded Wabash River in Warren County.Crests on the major rivers in central Indiana were as high as 15.5 feet above flood stage.",,"PDS"

The first round of snow occurred during the late afternoon of Tuesday January 4, as moisture streamed north over a stalled surface boundary located across central Illinois.  South of the boundary the surface dewpoints were around 60.  Due to dry air near the ground, snowfall accumulations were generally light with 1 to 3 inches south of Interstate 94.  As a low pressure center deepened in the Plains and pushed into the Mid-Mississippi Valley by Wednesday evening, widespread moderate to heavy snow began to develop across Nebraska, Iowa, and northern Illinois.  This shield of snow pushed north into southern Wisconsin Wednesday night and continued into Thursday morning, January 6th.  The start time in the header strip above reflects the time that 6 inch accumulations were reached.  The 3-day total ranged from 6 to 8 inches across Green Lake, Marquette, Fond du Lac and Sheboygan counties to 10 to almost 14 inches along and near the Illinois border.  Specific totals included 13.6 inches at the Kenosha WWTP (Kenosha Co.), 13.5 inches at the Janesville Airport (Rock Co.), 13 inches in Juneau (Dodge Co.), 12 inches on the UW-Milwaukee campus (Milwaukee Co.), 12 inches in Lake Geneva (Walworth Co.) and Monroe (Green Co.) as well as across extreme southern Lafayette County, 11 inches on the southwest side of Madison (Dane Co.) and in Burlington (Racine Co.), 10 inches in Rock Springs (Sauk Co.), and 9.6 inches at NOAA's NWS office about 3 miles southeast of Sullivan (Jefferson Co.).  In addition to heavy snow, brisk, sustained winds of 13 to 22 knots (15 to 25 mph), with occasional gusts to 30 knots (35 mph), resulted in considerable blowing and drifting snow.

The first round of snow occurred during the late afternoon of Tuesday January 4, as moisture streamed north over a stalled surface boundary located across central Illinois.  South of the boundary the surface dewpoints were around 60.  Due to dry air near the ground, snowfall accumulations were generally light with 1 to 3 inches south of Interstate 94.  As a low pressure center deepened in the Plains and pushed into the Mid-Mississippi Valley by Wednesday evening, widespread moderate to heavy snow began to develop across Nebraska, Iowa, and northern Illinois.  This shield of snow pushed north into southern Wisconsin Wednesday night and continued into Thursday morning, January 6th.  The start time in the header strip above reflects the time that 6 inch accumulations were reached.  The 3-day total ranged from 6 to 8 inches across Green Lake, Marquette, Fond du Lac and Sheboygan counties to 10 to almost 14 inches along and near the Illinois border.

The first round of snow occurred during the late afternoon of Tuesday January 4, as moisture streamed north over a stalled surface boundary located across central Illinois.  South of the boundary the surface dewpoints were around 60.  Due to dry air near the ground, snowfall accumulations were generally light with 1 to 3 inches south of Interstate 94.  As a low pressure center deepened in the Plains and pushed into the Mid-Mississippi Valley by Wednesday evening, widespread moderate to heavy snow began to develop across Nebraska, Iowa, and northern Illinois.  This shield of snow pushed north into southern Wisconsin Wednesday night and continued into Thursday morning, January 6th.  The start time in the header strip above reflects the time that 6 inch accumulations were reached.  The 3-day total ranged from 6 to 8 inches across Green Lake, Marquette, Fond du Lac and Sheboygan counties to 10 to almost 14 inches along and near the Illinois border.  Specific totals included 13.6 inches at the Kenosha WWTP (Kenosha Co.), 13.5 inches at the Janesville Airport (Rock Co.), 13 inches in Juneau (Dodge Co.), 12 inches on the UW-Milwaukee campus (Milwaukee Co.), 12 inches in Lake Geneva (Walworth Co.) and Monroe (Green Co.) as well as across extreme southern Lafayette County, 11 inches on the southwest side of Madison (Dane Co.) and in Burlington (Racine Co.), 10 inches in Rock Springs (Sauk Co.), and 9.6 inches at NOAA's NWS office about 3 miles southeast of Sullivan (Jefferson Co.).

The storm was a long and drawn out storm with a series of short waves lifting northeast across the area in a broad southwest flow aloft.  Deep moisture was available for the system with a tropical connection in place.  The main mechanism for the precipitation was isentropic lift.  During the early stages of the storm a considerable amount of warm air was drawn in over cool polar air at the surface.  The result was a mixture of freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow over the southeast third of the CWA during the first 6 to 12 hours of the event.  Much of the snow fell in two rounds, though snowfall occurred during the entire period.  The first came during the late evening of the 4th and early morning of the 5th and layed down a swath of several inches of new snow.  The second round came as low pressure formed along a stationary front to the south of Iowa.  Initially, the snow was the result of the warm air advection ahead of the low, then the deformation snow fell in the wake of the low.  The heaviest snow fell during the evening of the 5th, with another several inches of new snowfall.  The heaviest snow amounts fell from west central Iowa, from around Audubon, east through Ames, to near Waterloo.In this band, snowfall amounts in the 10 to 18 inch range were common.  Some of the heavier snowfall included 17.5 inches in Bremer County at Denver, 16.5 inches northeast of Ames in  Story County, 16 inches in Bremer County at Frederika, 15 inches in Roland in Story County, and 14.6 inches in Polk County at Johnston.  To the south of the heavy snow band, icing was a common problem.  Much of Iowa south of Interstate 80 received at least some icing with one tenth of an inch or more common.  Over the south two tiers of Iowa Counties, one quarter to as much as three quarters of an inch of ice accumulated before the freezing rain changed to snow.  Travel was hazardous across the state with many roads snow blocked and the Iowa D.O.T. recommending no travel.  Nearly every school district in the CWA cancelled classes on the 5th and numerous other activities were cancelled or postponed.  Winds during the storm were generally in the 20 to 25 MPH range with some higher gusts to around 35 MPH.  There were reports of some blowing snow in open areas and considerable drifting occurred at all locations.",,"PDS"

The first round of snow occurred during the late afternoon of Tuesday January 4, as moisture streamed north over a stalled surface boundary located across central Illinois.  South of the boundary the surface dewpoints were around 60.  Due to dry air near the ground, snowfall accumulations were generally light with 1 to 3 inches south of Interstate 94.  As a low pressure center deepened in the Plains and pushed into the Mid-Mississippi Valley by Wednesday evening, widespread moderate to heavy snow began to develop across Nebraska, Iowa, and northern Illinois.  This shield of snow pushed north into southern Wisconsin Wednesday night and continued into Thursday morning, January 6th.  The start time in the header strip above reflects the time that 6 inch accumulations were reached.  The 3-day total ranged from 6 to 8 inches across Green Lake, Marquette, Fond du Lac and Sheboygan counties to 10 to almost 14 inches along and near the Illinois border.  Specific totals included 13.6 inches at the Kenosha WWTP (Kenosha Co.), 13.5 inches at the Janesville Airport (Rock Co.), 13 inches in Juneau (Dodge Co.), 12 inches on the UW-Milwaukee campus (Milwaukee Co.), 12 inches in Lake Geneva (Walworth Co.) and Monroe (Green Co.) as well as across extreme southern Lafayette County, 11 inches on the southwest side of Madison (Dane Co.) and in Burlington (Racine Co.), 10 inches in Rock Springs (Sauk Co.), and 9.6 inches at NOAA's NWS office about 3 miles southeast of Sullivan (Jefferson Co.).

Surface temperatures to the north of the front were generally in the 20s and did not warm above freezing as the front lifted north.  Low level winds of 40 to 50 kts pushed warm and moist air over the cold dome, producing freezing rain over much of Iowa.  At the onset, all of the precipitation was in the form of freezing rain.  Much of the south half of Iowa saw temperatures warm above freezing during the day.  A glaze of a few hundredths of an inch to a tenth of an inch or so was common over all of the CWA.  Heavier rainfall occurred over the north and northeast sections of the CWA with reports of one quarter to two thirds of an inch of icing.  Travel was difficult as the rain adhered to the road surfaces quite easily with surface temperatures in the 20s.",,"PDS"

Temperatures rose slowly from 9 to 14 degrees above zero into the lower 20s as northeast winds increased up to 15 to 25 mph during this time.  Driving was hazardous and there were widespread impacts to mass transit.  The State of New Jersey declared a State of Emergency during this time.  As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 45 mph.  This caused blowing and drifting snow through Sunday, January 23rd.Storm total snowfalls ranged from 8.0 to 16.0 inches across the region.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:Passaic County - from 8.2 inches at Hawthorne to 15.0 inches at Little Falls.Bergen County - from 8.0 inches at Hillsdale to 15.0 inches at Elmwood Park.Essex County - from 10.1 inches at Belleville to 16.0 inches at West Orange.

Sunday Creek crested at 15.8 feet on the 6th at Glouster, and near 23 feet at Millfield.  On Monday Creek, the gauge at Doanville crested at 19.1 feet on the 6th.  In Perry County, 9 families were evacuated.  The small stream flooding across Vinton County was limited to flooded roads.  Significant river flooding occurred on the Muskingum, the Hocking, and the Ohio River.  The crest on the Hocking River at Athens was 23.7 feet around 1100E on the 7th.  This was the highest level since the 24.65 feet observed on the 25th of May in 1968. It was the highest stage since the river was rechanneled in 1972. The crest level was also the 5th highest on record for Athens.  Communities such as Nelsonville and Chauncey were flooded.  The lowest and most vulnerable sections of Chauncey had water inside dwellings and other buildings.  In Athens, the storm drainage system backup into the business area along East State Street.  Some homes on Blick Avenue were flooded.  West Union Street was also flooded and closed.  Elsewhere in Athens County, the high water along the Ohio River affected Hockingport.  All total, about 73 homes in Athens County had minor damage, 56 homes had major damage, and 11 homes were destroyed.  About a dozen businesses applied for disaster loans.In McConnelsville of Morgan County, the Muskingum River crested at 13.45 feet around 1400E on the 6th.  This was the highest level since the 13.8 feet seen back in March 1964.  Water rescues were performed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the county sheriff department.  An 85 year old woman was rescued from her flooded mobile home along the Muskingum River on the 6th.  She did not want to evacuate earlier and had her pets inside.  When finally rescued, she was sitting on a chair, with water almost up to her knees.  Her feet were swollen.  She never recovered from the hypothermia, and died several days later.   A second crest would occur less than a week later, from additional rain and dam releases.  See the 12th for details.  In Morgan County, around 142 homes had minor damage.  One furniture store in McConnelsville had flood waters inside.     In Washington County, small stream and river damage was less severe than in September 2004.  The Ohio River crested at 41.0 feet at Marietta 2SW during the predawn hours of the 8th.  The crest was 42.4 feet the previous September.  Flood stage is 34 feet.  Downtown Marietta streets and businesses were still flooded, but sandbags protected most 1st floors.  Further down the Ohio River, Racine Lock and Dam crested at 48.9 feet.  The crest at Pomeroy was 50.5 feet around 0000E on the 9th.  Flood stage is 46 feet at Pomeroy.  Back in September 2004 the crest was 51.2 feet.  Water still got into businesses.  All total, Meigs County had 17 homes with minor damage, 2 homes with major damage, and 3 homes destroyed.  Five businesses had major damage and 1 business was destroyed.     The crest near Gallipolis, at the RC Byrd Lock and Dam was 50.3 feet around 1400E on the 9th.  This was just over the 50 foot flood stage.  For the Chesapeake to South Point reach of the river, the Huntington gauge crested at 51.8 feet during the evening hours of the 9th.  This was about 6 inches higher than in September 2004.  Flood stage at Huntington is 50 feet.  Around 0845E on the 6th, just north of the Belleville Lock and Dam, the tugboat Jon Strong was heading up the Ohio River.  After passing through the lock chamber, 9 of the 12 barges came loose in the strong currents.  Three of barges sank under the gates of the dam, while 3 others were forced up against the dam pier houses.  Three other barges went through the structure and were recovered downstream.  Salvage crews did not remove all the damaged barges until the last day of the month.  Since the gates could not be closed, the pool above Belleville Lock and Dam dropped 10 to 15 feet below normal.  River traffic was suspended on the 19th.  River bank slippage occurred around Hockingport during the unusually low levels late in the month.  This caused damage to roads and a few homes. Water levels returned toward normal in early February.",,"PDS"

The Spokane Area also got heavy snow with 7 inches reported at the National Weather Service Office while the Spokane International Airport measured 5 inches of new snow. The Northeast Mountains received 6 to 12 inches while a spotter reported 5 inches at Colville and also at Chewelah. Spotters in Deer Park reported 4 to 5 inches of new snow. In the Okanogan Highlands, spotters reported around 11 inches of new snow near the town of Kettle Falls while a spotter reported 8 inches at Chesaw. In the Wenatchee Area, spotters reported 8 inches in the town of Wenachee while a spotter reported 4 inches of new snow at Entiat. In the East Slopes of the Northern Cascades a spotter reported 11 inches of new snow at the town of Mazama while a spotter at Plain reported 5 inches. Heavy snow also fell in the Okanogan Valley with 8 inches being reported by a spotter in the town of Okanogan and 9 inches being reported in the town of Malott.

Lowland flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County.  The White River in southern Indiana rose to bankfull levels.  This was the result of the melting snow cover.With warm air over Indiana, a storm system brought 2 to 4 inches of rain to much of central and southern Indiana from the 1st through the 3rd.  Because of the saturated soil conditions, widespread local flooding occurred in central and southern Indiana.  The major rivers in the state were flooding by the 4th. Another storm system quickly followed from the 4th through the 6th. This storm system tracked across southern Indiana and brought 2 to possibly 5 inches of rain to central and southern Indiana.  Because much of this rain fell as freezing rain just north of Indianapolis, two very significant weather events occurred; a major ice storm and flood.Major flooding resulted along the White, East Fork White and Wabash River in southern Indiana.  Flood levels that had not been seen in 40, 50 or more than 90 years occurred just south of the Indianapolis area.  New record stages were set at the White River at Edwardsport and the Wabash River at Mount Carmel.  The White River at Hazleton approached its record stage.Flooding in southern Indiana was much worse than the January 1991 flood.  Areas affected in the January 1991 flood were affected again and more severely.  These included Shelbyville, Rushville, Seymour, Wheeler Hollow, Bedford, Shoals, Spencer, Elnora, Edwardsport, Petersburg area, Hazleton, East Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Numerous state roads and local roads flooded by several feet.  Many local agricultural levees were overtopped.As this flood unfolded, cold air behind this storm system shut off the rain but left several inches of snow covering central and northern Indiana on the 7th and 8th.  Flooding fighting in southern Indiana occurred during rather harsh January conditions from the 7th through the 10th.  Milder conditions returned on the 11th.Some of the significant events during this flood include:Columbus, a large city in southern Indiana, had only one access road to I-65 causing long traffic delays.   Sandbagging efforts to save a power substation that served much of Rushville.A flood fight in Shelbyville to keep the Big Blue River from portions of the town.At least 70% of Jackson County was flooded.  Evacuations occurred in Rockford, Shields and Brownstown area.A levee failed along the Eel River in the Jasonville area.  Flood waters rose to within 10 inches of a power box for the Jasonville water system.  Power was shut down and the town lost its water until flood levels receded.Spencer lost wastewater treatment service.  This closed nearly all the restaurants in town.  Flood waters were within 2 ½ blocks of the Owen county courthouse.Flood waters at the Columbus wastewater treatment plant reached so high that employees were evacuated.  The plant was operated by the automated system for 12 hours.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard waged a major flood fight to save the Hazleton levee that protected nearly ½ of the town.  At times the levee partially failed but was reinforced.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard sandbagged at State Road 64 to protect East Mount Carmel, Indiana.  Sandbagging occurred on the Illinois side near Rochester.Potential major problems at the Edwardsport Power Plant on the White River were averted.Coal shipment to a major power plant in Gibson County was threatened by high levels on the Wabash River.  The situation was monitored closely.Local Sandbagging in the Elnora area saved several homes.While major flooding was spreading throughout southern Indiana, central Indiana experienced extensive flooding on the White River from Muncie through Indianapolis and the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Sandbagging was necessary in Anderson and Ravenswood areas.   The warmer temperatures on the 11th began to melt the snow and ice that covered central and northern Indiana.  An additional 1 to 4 inches of rain fell in much of central Indiana late on the 11th.  This caused flash flooding in portions of Delaware, Madison, Tipton and Howard Counties.  The most serious flooding was in the towns of Alexandria and Kokomo.  Significant flooding occurred in Albany and Eaton.  Flooding returned to the White River in central Indiana as a result of the rain on the 11th.   After reaching a crest, the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes began to rise again.  January 12 was the warmest and one of the driest days in the New Year.  Temperatures in central and southern Indiana soared into the 60s.  Mild conditions were short lived.As cold air pushed through Indiana on the 13th, an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain fell in central and southern Indiana.  This rain caused widespread local flooding.  Major flooding developed along the White River in Hamilton and northern Marion Counties.  Flood levels approached those of January 1991 in this area.  Evacuations occurred in the Ravenswood area.  Some homes had their power turned off because of high water levels.Major flooding developed on the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes as a result of the rain on the 13th.  Flood levels in the Lafayette and Covington areas reached their highest levels since July 2003.  Flooding from Montezuma to near Vincennes was the highest since June 1958.As this major flood crest was moving downstream along the Wabash River, flood fighting occurred under very brutal conditions.  Temperatures fell below freezing late on the 14th.  Snow of 1 to 4 inches fell in much of eastern Illinois and central Indiana on the 16th.  Temperatures dropped below zero on the 17th and 18th in the Hutsonville and Vincennes areas.  Temperature moderated to more normal levels by 19th.Areas along the Wabash River most severely flooded included, Montezuma, Clinton, Taylorville and Riverview in Indiana and Darwin, York, and Hutsonville in Illinois.  Flood waters overtopped many local agricultural levels.  Flood waters affected the cemetery at Palestine, Illinois. As the Wabash River approached record levels at Hutsonville, the Island Creek levee across from the Hutsonville Power Plant failed during the late evening on the 17th.  The level of the Wabash River fell 5 inches immediately in the town of Hutsonville.  Daylight revealed the levee breach was 300 to 500 feet wide and covered 5,000 acres of farmland with 7 to 8 feet of flood waters.  This breach damaged State Road 154 between Hutsonville and Grayville.  Now a short 5 mile drive for local residents was a 70 mile one way journey. The breach of the Island Creek levee caused the Wabash River to crest immediately at Hutsonville and very soon afterwards at Riverton.  The river crested at Vincennes within a day after the levee failure.  Water flowing back into the river from the area protected by the Island Creek levee caused another crest at Riverton and Vincennes.  This level was slightly lower than the crest after the breach.Rain on the 11th and 13th fell as the rivers were near crest in the Petersburg, Hazleton and Mount Carmel areas.  The combination of rain and very cold temperatures hindered flood fighting in these areas.  By the 13th the rivers crested at Petersburg, Hazleton, Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Flood waters would continue to recede for the remainder of January, although at times very slowly. The flood crest at New Harmony was the highest since January 1950.Another crest followed the major flood that had occurred along the White and East Fork White Rivers in much of southern Indiana.  This crest was 2 to 3 feet lower on the White River from Centerton to Edwardsport.  On the East Fork White River this crest was more than 8 feet lower in the Columbus and Bedford areas and 1 ½ feet lower at Seymour.  These crests washed out as they approached Petersburg.  The great flood of January 2005 began to wind down at all locations on the 20th.  Mother Nature had thrown every type of severe winter weather at the residents in the Wabash River Valley. Upwards of 30 inches of snow and 12 inches of water had fallen during the prior 30 days.By the end of January flooding had ended everywhere in the Wabash River Valley except for lowland flooding along portions of the Wabash River.  Millions of dollars in flood damage had occurred since the beginning of winter.  The great flood of January 2005 was the most extensive in areal coverage for Indiana since March 1913 and possibly unprecedented.  At least 4,000 homes and businesses flooded and more than 7,000 people displaced.  One person died while attempting to cross the extensively flooded Wabash River in Warren County.Crests on the major rivers in central Indiana were as high as 15.5 feet above flood stage.",,"PDS"

The river crested at Vincennes within a day after the levee failure.  Water flowing back into the river from the area protected by the Island Creek levee caused another crest at Riverton and Vincennes.  This level was slightly lower than the crest after the breach.Rain on the 11th and 13th fell as the rivers were near crest in the Petersburg, Hazleton and Mount Carmel areas.  The combination of rain and very cold temperatures hindered flood fighting in these areas.  By the 13th the rivers crested at Petersburg, Hazleton, Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Flood waters would continue to recede for the remainder of January, although at times very slowly. The flood crest at New Harmony was the highest since January 1950.Another crest followed the major flood that had occurred along the White and East Fork White Rivers in much of southern Indiana.  This crest was 2 to 3 feet lower on the White River from Centerton to Edwardsport.  On the East Fork White River this crest was more than 8 feet lower in the Columbus and Bedford areas and 1 ½ feet lower at Seymour.  These crests washed out as they approached Petersburg.  The great flood of January 2005 began to wind down at all locations on the 20th.  Mother Nature had thrown every type of severe winter weather at the residents in the Wabash River Valley. Upwards of 30 inches of snow and 12 inches of water had fallen during the prior 30 days.By the end of January flooding had ended everywhere in the Wabash River Valley except for lowland flooding along portions of the Wabash River.  Millions of dollars in flood damage had occurred since the beginning of winter.  The great flood of January 2005 was the most extensive in areal coverage for Indiana since March 1913 and possibly unprecedented.  At least 4,000 homes and businesses flooded and more than 7,000 people displaced.  One person died while attempting to cross the extensively flooded Wabash River in Warren County.Crests on the major rivers in central Indiana were as high as 15.5 feet above flood stage.",,"PDS"

Highway 62, State Route 60 and State Route 83 had be closed because of flooding.  In Wayne County, flooding was reported in Wooster along Grosjean, Spruce, South and Henry Streets.  State Routes 3, 95, 301 and 302 also had to be closed because of flooding.  Damage to just the state routes in the county totaled nearly $500,000.  January rainfall totals from the cooperative observer network included: 6.54 inches at Wooster (Wayne County); 6.93 inches at Congress (Wayne County); 5.71 inches at Marshallville (Wayne County) and 6.44 inches at Millersburg (Holmes County).  In addition to this rain, extensive snowpack existed over Wayne and Holmes Counties at the beginning of the month.  Temperatures in the 50s the first three days of the month caused a rapid snowmelt and brought area streams and creeks to bankfull just in time for the record ice storm on the 5th and 6th.  Sump pump failures caused by power outages resulting from this storm led to many homes sustaining damage from basement flooding.  Then, just as the flood waters began to recede, more heavy rain fell on the 11th, 12th and 13th causing conditions to once again worsen.   Well over a thousand homes reported flood related damages.  A few of the homes, especially along Killbuck Creek were heavily damaged.",,"PDS"

Significant flooding was also reported in Clyde on January 11th through the 13th.  Flood waters in portions of the city came within 12 inches of exceeding the 100 year flood plain.  January 2005 was among the wettest January's on record with 5.99 inches measured at Tiffin and 6.55 inches measured at Fremont.  In addition to this rain, extensive snowpack existed over Sandusky County at the beginning of the month.  Temperatures in the 40s and 50s the first three days of the month caused a rapid snowmelt and brought area streams and creeks to bankfull just in time for a significant winter storm on the 5th and 6th.  Then, just as things began to return to normal, heavy rains fell on the area on the 11th, 12th and 13th causing conditions to once again worsen.  Hundreds of homes in the county sustained damage from river, basement or nuisance flooding.  Several streets were closed by flooding in Woodville with over a dozen roads closed elsewhere in the county.",,"PDS"

As nasty as that storm was, it was exacerbated by another ice storm on January 8th. At one point, nearly three-quarters of Carbon County was without power and nearly 46,000 homes and businesses in Monroe County lost power.  Systemwide 238,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power and the total repair cost was estimated at $25,000,000. Metropolitan Edison reported about 40,000 of its customers lost power. Thousands upon thousands of trees were knocked down or damaged. The number of outages cascaded. There were only 1,000 the morning of the 6th, but that increased to 27,000 the afternoon of the 6th and 91,000 the evening of the 6th. There was only one direct injury from the storm, but a couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning trying to heat their powerless home. It took until January 16th for power to be completely restored. Hardest hit locations was in the Pocono Plateau region in Carbon and Monroe Counties. States of emergencies were declared in both Carbon and Monroe Counties. Numerous roads were closed because of ice and downed trees. Firefighters had to clear roads to respond to emergencies. Unnecessary driving was not recommended. Many shelters were opened. The Red Cross served over 6,000 meals. Many hotels that had electricity were booked solid. Bottled water was distributed. While downed trees also caused power outages in the Lehigh Valley, it did not match the damage in the Poconos. Ironically precipitation started as plain rain before dawn on the 5th. It changed to freezing rain over the higher terrain of the Poconos during the first part of the morning and then changed to snow later that morning. Precipitation changed back to freezing rain around Midnight EST on the 6th in the Lehigh Valley and a bit after Midnight EST in the Poconos. Freezing rain also occurred in northern parts of Berks and Bucks Counties between Midnight EST and 7 a.m. EST on the 6th before precipitation changed back to plain rain. The change to plain rain worked its way north into the Lehigh Valley during the morning of the 6th, but precipitation remained freezing rain throughout most of the Poconos. Ice accretions in the Lehigh Valley averaged between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch and between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch in the Poconos.  Snowfall accumulations in the Poconos were between one and three inches.  In Monroe County, a 57-year-old man and his 73-year-old companion died of carbon monoxide poisoning. They were running an gas-powered electrical generator in a garage beneath the home as well as two kerosene heaters. The fumes from the generator were not properly ventilated. Their pet cat also died. Dozens of others were taken to Pocono Medical Center with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. The only known injury was a 47-year-old PennDOT worker who was injured when a tree fell onto his truck and he injured his shoulder.  At least seventy trees fell on top of vehicles and homes. Emergency services in Monroe County responded to 1,300 calls on the 7th, the normal response number for an entire weekend. Schools were closed from the 5th through the 10th. All reopened on the 11th, except for the Pocono Mountain School District which did not re-open until the 12th. Many crashes occurred on Interstate 80. Too many roads were closed to keep track. Six major roads were still closed on the 7th. The Pocono Plateau was described as a war zone from Mount Pocono to Tobyhanna to Blakeslee. Fields were filled with downed trees and power lines. Even months later, the drive along Interstate 80 looks as though a large tornado sheared the tops from thousands of trees. The restoration efforts were thwarted by temperatures that did not get to the mid 30s in the Pocono Plateau until the 10th. About 32,000 homes and businesses still had no power on the 7th just as the next ice storm was starting. In Carbon County, the worst tree damage occurred in Penn Forest and Kidder Townships. That was followed by damage in Mahoning and Towamensing Townships. The Penn Forest Fire Company set a daily record for emergency responses. Entire boroughs and townships lost power. Telephone service was also lost in Penn Forest and Kidder Townships. U.S. Routes 309 and 209 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 54, 93 and 902 were all closed.  It took until the 10th to have all of the major roads opened. Nine shelters were opened in fire stations, community centers and churches. schools were closed from the 5th through the 9th. Ironically, the impossible traveling conditions resulted in no reported traffic accidents in Kidder Township. Power was finally restored on the 16th to the hardest hit Indian Mountain Lakes, Towamensing Trails and Mount Pocohontas Developments in Penn Forest Township. In the Lehigh Valley, the worst conditions occurred at the northern end of the valley. In Lehigh County, all power was out in New Tripoli and the northern end of Washington Township. In Northampton County, Metropolitan Edison reported about 2,000 of its customers lost power. A state of emergency was declared in Upper Mount Bethel due to extensive power outages. Shelters were opened (three shelters were opened countywide). Downed trees and power outages were also reported in Bangor Borough, Plainfield Township, Bushkill Township, Wind Gap Borough, Pen Argyl Borough and Mount Bethel Township. Power outages were reported as far south as Nazareth. Snowfall accumulations included 3.0 inches in Pocono Summit (Monroe County) and 2.2 inches at the F.E. Walter Dam (Carbon County). Ice accretions included 0.75 of an inch in Tobyhanna (Monroe County), 0.5 of an inch in Albrightsville (Carbon County) and Heidelberg Township (Lehigh County) and 0.33 of an inch in Lehighton (Carbon County). The set was stage for the ice storm when a cold front moved through the region on the 4th. This allowed a cold air mass in the low levels to establish itself in the region.

As nasty as that storm was, it was exacerbated by another ice storm on January 8th. At one point, nearly three-quarters of Carbon County was without power and nearly 46,000 homes and businesses in Monroe County lost power.  Systemwide 238,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power and the total repair cost was estimated at $25,000,000. Metropolitan Edison reported about 40,000 of its customers lost power. Thousands upon thousands of trees were knocked down or damaged. The number of outages cascaded. There were only 1,000 the morning of the 6th, but that increased to 27,000 the afternoon of the 6th and 91,000 the evening of the 6th. There was only one direct injury from the storm, but a couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning trying to heat their powerless home. It took until January 16th for power to be completely restored. Hardest hit locations was in the Pocono Plateau region in Carbon and Monroe Counties. States of emergencies were declared in both Carbon and Monroe Counties. Numerous roads were closed because of ice and downed trees. Firefighters had to clear roads to respond to emergencies. Unnecessary driving was not recommended. Many shelters were opened. The Red Cross served over 6,000 meals. Many hotels that had electricity were booked solid. Bottled water was distributed. While downed trees also caused power outages in the Lehigh Valley, it did not match the damage in the Poconos. Ironically precipitation started as plain rain before dawn on the 5th. It changed to freezing rain over the higher terrain of the Poconos during the first part of the morning and then changed to snow later that morning. Precipitation changed back to freezing rain around Midnight EST on the 6th in the Lehigh Valley and a bit after Midnight EST in the Poconos. Freezing rain also occurred in northern parts of Berks and Bucks Counties between Midnight EST and 7 a.m. EST on the 6th before precipitation changed back to plain rain. The change to plain rain worked its way north into the Lehigh Valley during the morning of the 6th, but precipitation remained freezing rain throughout most of the Poconos. Ice accretions in the Lehigh Valley averaged between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch and between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch in the Poconos.  Snowfall accumulations in the Poconos were between one and three inches.  In Monroe County, a 57-year-old man and his 73-year-old companion died of carbon monoxide poisoning. They were running an gas-powered electrical generator in a garage beneath the home as well as two kerosene heaters. The fumes from the generator were not properly ventilated. Their pet cat also died. Dozens of others were taken to Pocono Medical Center with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. The only known injury was a 47-year-old PennDOT worker who was injured when a tree fell onto his truck and he injured his shoulder.  At least seventy trees fell on top of vehicles and homes. Emergency services in Monroe County responded to 1,300 calls on the 7th, the normal response number for an entire weekend. Schools were closed from the 5th through the 10th. All reopened on the 11th, except for the Pocono Mountain School District which did not re-open until the 12th. Many crashes occurred on Interstate 80. Too many roads were closed to keep track. Six major roads were still closed on the 7th. The Pocono Plateau was described as a war zone from Mount Pocono to Tobyhanna to Blakeslee. Fields were filled with downed trees and power lines. Even months later, the drive along Interstate 80 looks as though a large tornado sheared the tops from thousands of trees. The restoration efforts were thwarted by temperatures that did not get to the mid 30s in the Pocono Plateau until the 10th. About 32,000 homes and businesses still had no power on the 7th just as the next ice storm was starting. In Carbon County, the worst tree damage occurred in Penn Forest and Kidder Townships. That was followed by damage in Mahoning and Towamensing Townships. The Penn Forest Fire Company set a daily record for emergency responses. Entire boroughs and townships lost power. Telephone service was also lost in Penn Forest and Kidder Townships. U.S. Routes 309 and 209 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 54, 93 and 902 were all closed.  It took until the 10th to have all of the major roads opened. Nine shelters were opened in fire stations, community centers and churches. schools were closed from the 5th through the 9th. Ironically, the impossible traveling conditions resulted in no reported traffic accidents in Kidder Township. Power was finally restored on the 16th to the hardest hit Indian Mountain Lakes, Towamensing Trails and Mount Pocohontas Developments in Penn Forest Township. In the Lehigh Valley, the worst conditions occurred at the northern end of the valley. In Lehigh County, all power was out in New Tripoli and the northern end of Washington Township. In Northampton County, Metropolitan Edison reported about 2,000 of its customers lost power. A state of emergency was declared in Upper Mount Bethel due to extensive power outages. Shelters were opened (three shelters were opened countywide). Downed trees and power outages were also reported in Bangor Borough, Plainfield Township, Bushkill Township, Wind Gap Borough, Pen Argyl Borough and Mount Bethel Township. Power outages were reported as far south as Nazareth. Snowfall accumulations included 3.0 inches in Pocono Summit (Monroe County) and 2.2 inches at the F.E. Walter Dam (Carbon County). Ice accretions included 0.75 of an inch in Tobyhanna (Monroe County), 0.5 of an inch in Albrightsville (Carbon County) and Heidelberg Township (Lehigh County) and 0.33 of an inch in Lehighton (Carbon County).

January 2005 was one of the wettest January's on record with 5.48 inches of rain measured by cooperative observers in Florence.  In addition to this rain, extensive snowpack existed over Erie County at the beginning of the month.  Temperatures in the 40s and 50s the first three days of the month caused a rapid snowmelt and brought area streams and creeks to bankfull just in time for a significant winter storm on the 5th and 6th.

Snow began falling during the late morning of the 22nd, fell at its heaviest during the second half of the afternoon and early part of the evening of the 22nd. The snow ended during the morning of the 23rd, except in the Poconos where it lingered into the afternoon. Gusty northwest winds which followed in the wake of the storm caused considerable drifting snow and hampered road crews efforts as drifts continued to form on roads through the night of the 23rd. The unseasonably cold weather also rendered the salt less effective. The heavy snow caused the closure of Philadelphia International Airport for the first time in 9 years since the Blizzard of January 1996.  Many sporting, community events and church services were cancelled. Museums and malls closed early. Prior to the snows arrival many supermarkets and video stores were reporting record sales. Snow emergencies were declared by many municipalities. Several men died from heart attacks while shoveling snow in Montgomery County. Many businesses never opened on Sunday the 23rd. But, the snow was cleared in time for the NFC Championship game to be played against the Eagles and Falcons during the afternoon of the 23rd. Many schools were closed on the 24th. The remainder that opened had delayed openings. The number of traffic accidents were held down because this event occurred over a weekend. The biggest problems were vehicles that became stuck on roadways.  Nevertheless, there were two reported fatal accidents. A 42-year-old man died in a two vehicle crash in Hereford Township (Berks County) after he lost control of his vehicle on Pennsylvania State Route 100 and spun into oncoming traffic. In Carbon County, a man died after he drove his car into a wall. For the first time in 9 years, Philadelphia International Airport was closed for about 5 hours on the 22nd. Eight hundred passengers were stranded. Only half of the normal flights left the airport on the 23rd. Around the city, about 50 SEPTA bus routes were detoured. Homeless people were sheltered as code blues were continued. Even on the 24th, regional rail lines had delays of up to 30 minutes. Several SEPTA bus routes were still detoured. In the Lehigh Valley, the International Airport remained open, but numerous flights were cancelled. In Palmer Township, (Northampton County) an elderly man was rescued from the Bushkill Creek after his pick-up truck skidded off the road into the creek.  The snow complicated a fire that tore through two historic buildings in Bethlehem (Northampton County). The fire destroyed the roofs, interior and upstairs of two businesses. Three firefighters were injured. In the Lehigh Valley, pre-schools, nursery schools and day care centers were closed on the 24th. In the Poconos, the low temperature of 10 degrees below zero in Mount Pocono before the arrival of the snow was the lowest reading of the winter. The snow also complicated a house that was burned in Ross Township.Specific snowfall accumulations 15.8 inches in Yardley (Bucks County), 14.9 inches in Forks Township (Northampton County), 13.6 inches in Radnor (Delaware County), 13.5 inches in Conshohocken (Montgomery County), 13.4 inches in northeast Philadelphia, 13.0 inches in Albrightsville (Carbon County) and Langhorne (Bucks County), 12.6 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport, 12.0 inches in Perkasie (Bucks County) and Easton (Northampton County), 11.8 inches in Phoenixville (Chester County), 11.5 inches in Lehighton (Carbon County), 11.0 inches in Boothwyn (Delaware County), Palm and Green Lane (Montgomery County) and Saylorsburg (Monroe County), 10.6 inches at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 10.2 inches in Germansville (Lehigh County), 10.0 inches in Morgantown (Berks County) and Pocono Summit (Monroe County) and 8.0 inches in Honey Brook (Chester County) The winter storm was caused by a very powerful Alberta low pressure system. This type of low rarely produce snowfalls of this intensity. This low moved southeast from eastern Montana on the morning of the 21st to southern Minnesota on the evening of the 21st to near Dayton, Ohio around sunrise on the 22nd. It then moved to just south of Erie, Pennsylvania on the afternoon of the 22nd. A secondary low pressure system formed over lower Chesapeake Bay on the afternoon of the 22nd.

Snow began falling throughout the state during the late morning of the 22nd. In Sussex County, the snow changed to freezing rain inland and rain at the coast during the afternoon. Precipitation then changed back to snow before it ended during the evening. Farther north, the heaviest snow fell during the afternoon, but lighter (and still accumulating) snow fell into the morning of the 23rd. Accumulations ranged from around 1 inch along coastal Sussex County to nearly 10 inches in northern New Castle County. Around 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces in interior Sussex County and caused power outages as tree limbs and power lines came down. Gusty northwest winds which followed in the wake of the storm caused considerable drifting snow and hampered road crews efforts as drifts continued to form on roads through the night of the 23rd. More than 160 accidents occurred across the state on the 22nd, many during the first hour of snowfall. In New Castle County, about 40 motorists became stranded on the 22nd. The only reported fatal accident occurred in Sussex County (near Milton) on the morning of the 23rd when a 48-year-old man died after the car he was driving slid on a patch of ice and overturned.  Delaware Emergency Management and local police recommended that only essential personnel travel. Most businesses closed early on the 22nd in New Castle County. Even New Castle County Airport closed early. Many sporting, community events and church services were cancelled. Many businesses never opened on Sunday the 23rd. The icy roads and strong winds hampered firefighters fighting a blaze in Bethany Beach. One firefighter was injured after slipping on the ice.

Enough warm air moved in near the surface to change the precipitation to plain rain in Berks County and the Lehigh Valley toward evening. Farther north, precipitation fell as mainly freezing rain or freezing drizzle. The freezing rain ended during the late evening, but freezing drizzle persisted through the night. For the Poconos, unlike the two earlier events in the month, more precipitation fell as snow than freezing rain. Ice accretions throughout the region averaged less than one-tenth of an inch. Snow accumulations averaged one to three inches with the highest amounts in the Poconos. Schools in the Lehigh Valley dismissed early.

Only Cape May County and coastal Atlantic County were spared heavy accumulations. In northern and southwestern New Jersey accumulations ranged from 8 to 17 inches with the highest amounts in Ocean, Burlington, Monmouth and Middlesex Counties. Across southeastern New Jersey accumulations ranged from around 10 inches in interior Atlantic and Cumberland Counties to less than an inch along coastal Cape May County. Seventeen of the twenty-one New Jersey counties reported at least one measurement of a foot or greater of snow. Governor Richard Codey declared a state of emergency from 8 p.m. EST on the 22nd through 8 a.m. EST on the 23rd. Vehicles were required to stay off of public roads and thoroughfares. Snow began falling during the late morning of the 22nd, fell at its heaviest during the second half of the afternoon and early part of the evening of the 22nd. Snow mixed with sleet over interior sections of Atlantic County, in Cumberland County and in southern Ocean County. By the time the heavier precipitation arrived in extreme southeast New Jersey, enough of an onshore flow changed the snow to rain. The snow ended during the morning of the 23rd. Gusty northwest winds which followed in the wake of the storm caused considerable drifting snow and hampered road crews efforts as drifts continued to form on roads through the night of the 23rd. The unseasonably cold weather also rendered the salt less effective. Many of the reported accidents were minor. Some municipalities were reporting more sledding than vehicular accidents. Strong winds in Monmouth and Ocean Counties caused downed tree limbs and wires and caused about 15,000 homes and businesses to lose power. Many sporting, community events and church services were cancelled. Museums and malls closed early on the 22nd and many opened late on the 23rd. Even Rutgers University cancelled classes on the 22nd and 23rd. Prior to the snow's arrival many supermarkets and video stores were reporting record sales. Snow emergencies were declared by many municipalities. A Hopatcong (Morris County) man died shoveling snow. A pedestrian was struck and killed by a snow plow in Mercer County.  Many schools were closed on the 24th. The remainder that opened had delayed openings. Regional rail lines reported delays from the 22nd through the 24th. For the first time in 9 years, nearby Philadelphia International Airport was closed for about 5 hours on the 22nd. Eight hundred passengers were stranded. Only half of the normal flights left the airport on the 23rd. Specific snowfall accumulations included 17.0 inches in Howell (Monmouth County) and New Egypt (Ocean County), 16.5 inches in Wrightstown (Burlington County), Kingston (Somerset County) and Cream Ridge (Monmouth County), 15.7 inches in Parlin (Middlesex County), 15.4 inches in Whitehouse (Hunterdon County), 15.0 inches in Sussex (Sussex County), Hackettstown (Warren County), Tabernacle (Burlington County) and Hopewell (Mercer County), 14.7 inches in Brick Township (Ocean County), 14.4 inches in Belle Mead (Somerset County), 14.3 inches in Ewing (Mercer County) and New Brunswick (Middlesex County), 13.1 inches in Stewartsville (Warren County), 13.0 inches in Randolph (Morris County) 12.8 inches in Voorhees (Camden County), 12.3 inches in Morristown (Morris County), 12.2 inches in Mount Holly (Burlington County), 12.0 inches in Verga (Gloucester County) and Broadway (Warren County), 11.5 inches in Newport (Cumberland County) and Flemington (Hunterdon County),11.0 inches in Lindenwold (Camden County), 10.9 inches in Barry Lakes (Sussex County), 10.0 inches in Vineland (Cumberland County), 8.7 inches in Hammonton (Atlantic County) and Quinton (Salem County), 7.0 inches in Forked River (Ocean County), 3.5 inches in Woodbine (Cape May County), 3.4 inches at the Atlantic City International Airport, 1.7 inches in Margate (Atlantic County) and 0.5 inches in Cape May (Cape May County).The winter storm was caused by a very powerful Alberta low pressure system. This type of low rarely produce snowfalls of this intensity. This low moved southeast from eastern Montana on the morning of the 21st to southern Minnesota on the evening of the 21st to near Dayton, Ohio around sunrise on the 22nd. It then moved to just south of Erie, Pennsylvania on the afternoon of the 22nd. A secondary low pressure system formed over the lower Chesapeake Bay on the afternoon of the 22nd. It would become the main low over the next twelve hours as it intensified over the nearby Atlantic Ocean. It deepened quickly as it passed near the Nantucket, Massachusetts buoy at 7 a.m. EST on the 23rd.",,"PDS"

Southwest of the snow area...freezing drizzle coated roads, trees, and power lines over central and southwest Iowa.  There were scattered power outages due to fallen limbs, but little significant damage.  Traffic accidents were too numerous to mention due to near freezing temperatures allowing the initial snow to melt somewhat before the Arctic cold swept in.",,"PDS"

The storm was a long and drawn out storm with a series of short waves lifting northeast across the area in a broad southwest flow aloft.  Deep moisture was available for the system with a tropical connection in place.  The main mechanism for the precipitation was isentropic lift.  During the early stages of the storm a considerable amount of warm air was drawn in over cool polar air at the surface.  The result was a mixture of freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow over the southeast third of the CWA during the first 6 to 12 hours of the event.  Much of the snow fell in two rounds, though snowfall occurred during the entire period.  The first came during the late evening of the 4th and early morning of the 5th and layed down a swath of several inches of new snow.  The second round came as low pressure formed along a stationary front to the south of Iowa.  Initially, the snow was the result of the warm air advection ahead of the low, then the deformation snow fell in the wake of the low.  The heaviest snow fell during the evening of the 5th, with another several inches of new snowfall.  The heaviest snow amounts fell from west central Iowa, from around Audubon, east through Ames, to near Waterloo.In this band, snowfall amounts in the 10 to 18 inch range were common.  Some of the heavier snowfall included 17.5 inches in Bremer County at Denver, 16.5 inches northeast of Ames in  Story County, 16 inches in Bremer County at Frederika, 15 inches in Roland in Story County, and 14.6 inches in Polk County at Johnston.  To the south of the heavy snow band, icing was a common problem.  Much of Iowa south of Interstate 80 received at least some icing with one tenth of an inch or more common.  Over the south two tiers of Iowa Counties, one quarter to as much as three quarters of an inch of ice accumulated before the freezing rain changed to snow.  Travel was hazardous across the state with many roads snow blocked and the Iowa D.O.T. recommending no travel.  Nearly every school district in the CWA cancelled classes on the 5th and numerous other activities were cancelled or postponed.

To the south of the boundary, dew points were in the 50 to 55 degree range.  The heaviest rain amounts were from Perry County on north and east into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  Preliminary 5 day totals were 5.2 inches for New Lexington, 4.6 inches at McConnelsville, 4.5 inches at Nelsonville, 4.2 inches at McArthur and Beverly, 3.4 inches at Athens, and 2.9 inches at Marietta.  Small stream flooding started during the morning hours on the 5th, across Perry, Athens, Morgan, Vinton, and Washington Counties.  Some of the flooded streams included Jonathan Creek in northern Perry County, plus Monday and Sunday Creeks in southern Perry County and northern Athens County.   Sunday Creek crested at 15.8 feet on the 6th at Glouster, and near 23 feet at Millfield.  On Monday Creek, the gauge at Doanville crested at 19.1 feet on the 6th.  In Perry County, 9 families were evacuated.  The small stream flooding across Vinton County was limited to flooded roads.  Significant river flooding occurred on the Muskingum, the Hocking, and the Ohio River.  The crest on the Hocking River at Athens was 23.7 feet around 1100E on the 7th.  This was the highest level since the 24.65 feet observed on the 25th of May in 1968. It was the highest stage since the river was rechanneled in 1972. The crest level was also the 5th highest on record for Athens.  Communities such as Nelsonville and Chauncey were flooded.  The lowest and most vulnerable sections of Chauncey had water inside dwellings and other buildings.  In Athens, the storm drainage system backup into the business area along East State Street.  Some homes on Blick Avenue were flooded.  West Union Street was also flooded and closed.  Elsewhere in Athens County, the high water along the Ohio River affected Hockingport.  All total, about 73 homes in Athens County had minor damage, 56 homes had major damage, and 11 homes were destroyed.  About a dozen businesses applied for disaster loans.In McConnelsville of Morgan County, the Muskingum River crested at 13.45 feet around 1400E on the 6th.  This was the highest level since the 13.8 feet seen back in March 1964.  Water rescues were performed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the county sheriff department.  An 85 year old woman was rescued from her flooded mobile home along the Muskingum River on the 6th.  She did not want to evacuate earlier and had her pets inside.  When finally rescued, she was sitting on a chair, with water almost up to her knees.  Her feet were swollen.  She never recovered from the hypothermia, and died several days later.   A second crest would occur less than a week later, from additional rain and dam releases.  See the 12th for details.  In Morgan County, around 142 homes had minor damage.  One furniture store in McConnelsville had flood waters inside.     In Washington County, small stream and river damage was less severe than in September 2004.  The Ohio River crested at 41.0 feet at Marietta 2SW during the predawn hours of the 8th.  The crest was 42.4 feet the previous September.  Flood stage is 34 feet.  Downtown Marietta streets and businesses were still flooded, but sandbags protected most 1st floors.  Further down the Ohio River, Racine Lock and Dam crested at 48.9 feet.  The crest at Pomeroy was 50.5 feet around 0000E on the 9th.  Flood stage is 46 feet at Pomeroy.  Back in September 2004 the crest was 51.2 feet.  Water still got into businesses.  All total, Meigs County had 17 homes with minor damage, 2 homes with major damage, and 3 homes destroyed.  Five businesses had major damage and 1 business was destroyed.     The crest near Gallipolis, at the RC Byrd Lock and Dam was 50.3 feet around 1400E on the 9th.  This was just over the 50 foot flood stage.  For the Chesapeake to South Point reach of the river, the Huntington gauge crested at 51.8 feet during the evening hours of the 9th.  This was about 6 inches higher than in September 2004.  Flood stage at Huntington is 50 feet.  Around 0845E on the 6th, just north of the Belleville Lock and Dam, the tugboat Jon Strong was heading up the Ohio River.  After passing through the lock chamber, 9 of the 12 barges came loose in the strong currents.  Three of barges sank under the gates of the dam, while 3 others were forced up against the dam pier houses.  Three other barges went through the structure and were recovered downstream.  Salvage crews did not remove all the damaged barges until the last day of the month.  Since the gates could not be closed, the pool above Belleville Lock and Dam dropped 10 to 15 feet below normal.  River traffic was suspended on the 19th.  River bank slippage occurred around Hockingport during the unusually low levels late in the month.  This caused damage to roads and a few homes. Water levels returned toward normal in early February.",,"PDS"

As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 45 mph.  This caused blowing and drifting snow through Sunday, January 23rd.Storm total snowfalls ranged from 8.0 to 16.0 inches across the region.

The storm was a long and drawn out storm with a series of short waves lifting northeast across the area in a broad southwest flow aloft.  Deep moisture was available for the system with a tropical connection in place.  The main mechanism for the precipitation was isentropic lift.  During the early stages of the storm a considerable amount of warm air was drawn in over cool polar air at the surface.  The result was a mixture of freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow over the southeast third of the CWA during the first 6 to 12 hours of the event.  Much of the snow fell in two rounds, though snowfall occurred during the entire period.  The first came during the late evening of the 4th and early morning of the 5th and layed down a swath of several inches of new snow.  The second round came as low pressure formed along a stationary front to the south of Iowa.  Initially, the snow was the result of the warm air advection ahead of the low, then the deformation snow fell in the wake of the low.  The heaviest snow fell during the evening of the 5th, with another several inches of new snowfall.  The heaviest snow amounts fell from west central Iowa, from around Audubon, east through Ames, to near Waterloo.In this band, snowfall amounts in the 10 to 18 inch range were common.  Some of the heavier snowfall included 17.5 inches in Bremer County at Denver, 16.5 inches northeast of Ames in  Story County, 16 inches in Bremer County at Frederika, 15 inches in Roland in Story County, and 14.6 inches in Polk County at Johnston.  To the south of the heavy snow band, icing was a common problem.  Much of Iowa south of Interstate 80 received at least some icing with one tenth of an inch or more common.  Over the south two tiers of Iowa Counties, one quarter to as much as three quarters of an inch of ice accumulated before the freezing rain changed to snow.  Travel was hazardous across the state with many roads snow blocked and the Iowa D.O.T. recommending no travel.  Nearly every school district in the CWA cancelled classes on the 5th and numerous other activities were cancelled or postponed.  Winds during the storm were generally in the 20 to 25 MPH range with some higher gusts to around 35 MPH.  There were reports of some blowing snow in open areas and considerable drifting occurred at all locations.",,"PDS"

Temperatures at 850 mb over the south half to three quarters of Iowa rose to +9 C.  Surface temperatures to the north of the front were generally in the 20s and did not warm above freezing as the front lifted north.  Low level winds of 40 to 50 kts pushed warm and moist air over the cold dome, producing freezing rain over much of Iowa.  At the onset, all of the precipitation was in the form of freezing rain.  Much of the south half of Iowa saw temperatures warm above freezing during the day.  A glaze of a few hundredths of an inch to a tenth of an inch or so was common over all of the CWA.

Many avalanche paths ran full track, taking out mature timber, and several slides came out that haven't affected area roads in years. Avalanches caused closures of Red Mountain, Molas and Coal Bank Passes among other road closures.

Initially a winter storm warning was issued for this event, but as it became clear that whiteout conditions would develop, it was upgraded to a blizzard warning.  Many schools cancelled early on friday afternoon, and many evening events were also rescheduled.  Hundreds of vehicles were reported in the ditch.  Several flights into Hector International Airport (in Fargo, ND) were cancelled.  Numerous roads were closed.  Interstate 29 was closed its entire length in eastern North Dakota.

Then, just as things began to return to normal, heavy rains fell on the area on the 11th, 12th and 13th causing conditions to once again worsen.  At LaRue, the Scioto River went above the flood stage of 11 feet just after midnight on the 1st.  The river then remained in flood or just below flood through the middle of the month with crests of 12.7 feet on the 1st and 12.6 feet on the the 6th.

Significant ice accumulations occurred over most of the area downing thousands of trees, causing widespread power outages and making travel nearly impossible.  Low pressure over Missouri moved rapidly northeast on January 5th.  This low moved across eastern Ohio early on January 6th and was responsible for producing a prolonged period of freezing rain.  A mixture of rain and snow changed to freezing rain from west to east during the early morning hours of the 5th.  Periods of freezing rain then continued for the remainder of the 5th and through the early morning hours of the 6th.  Temperatures eventually warmed enough during the late morning hours of the 6th to change the freezing rain back to rain.  The hardest hit  locations were west of Interstate 71 along the U.S. Route 30 corridor.  Ice accumulations of greater than three quarters of an inch were reported from Hancock County eastward across Wyandot, Crawford, Richland and Ashland Counties.  Northern sections of Wyandot and Marion Counties along with the southern halves of Seneca and Huron County were also hard hit.  Up to 80 percent of electric customers in these nine counties lost service during the storm, some for as much as ten days.  In cities like Mansfield, Bucyrus and Findlay, nearly every property in some neighborhoods sustained tree damage.  To the north and south of these areas ice accumulations ranged from one quarter to three quarters of an inch.  Counties closer to Lake Erie saw snow mix with the freezing rain at times which kept ice accumulations down to around one quarter inch and resulted in only scattered power outages.  A total of 3 to 5 inches of snow was also reported in these counties.  Ice build up at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant (Ottawa County) damaged the facility enough to force it to be temporarily shut down.  Hundreds of crews were brought in from around the county to help restore the power outages.  In addition to damage caused by fallen trees and limbs, a lot of basement flooding occurred as power outages prevented sump pumps from working.  Clean up and repair costs for this storm were among the highest ever recorded for a natural disaster in Ohio.  Damage in many counties topped $1 million with a couple counties exceeding $10 million in losses.  In Richland County alone, clean up cost accrued by local governments totaled nearly $6 million.  Estimates indicate that as many as one million people lost power during this storm.  Several power companies reported the largest number of outages in their histories.  Hundreds if not thousands of homes and businesses were damaged by fallen trees, limbs and utility poles.",,"PDS"

The unseasonably cold weather continued code blue declarations to help the homeless, elderly, homebound and poor. It continued the high demand for heating oil, natural gas and electricity. There was also an increase in the number of slip and fall accidents. The cold weather increased the number of dead batteries.

Low pressure over Missouri moved rapidly northeast on January 5th.  This low moved across eastern Ohio early on January 6th and was responsible for producing a prolonged period of freezing rain.  A mixture of rain and snow changed to freezing rain from west to east during the early morning hours of the 5th.  Periods of freezing rain then continued for the remainder of the 5th and through the early morning hours of the 6th.  Temperatures eventually warmed enough during the late morning hours of the 6th to change the freezing rain back to rain.  The hardest hit  locations were west of Interstate 71 along the U.S. Route 30 corridor.  Ice accumulations of greater than three quarters of an inch were reported from Hancock County eastward across Wyandot, Crawford, Richland and Ashland Counties.  Northern sections of Wyandot and Marion Counties along with the southern halves of Seneca and Huron County were also hard hit.  Up to 80 percent of electric customers in these nine counties lost service during the storm, some for as much as ten days.  In cities like Mansfield, Bucyrus and Findlay, nearly every property in some neighborhoods sustained tree damage.  To the north and south of these areas ice accumulations ranged from one quarter to three quarters of an inch.  Counties closer to Lake Erie saw snow mix with the freezing rain at times which kept ice accumulations down to around one quarter inch and resulted in only scattered power outages.  A total of 3 to 5 inches of snow was also reported in these counties.  Ice build up at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant (Ottawa County) damaged the facility enough to force it to be temporarily shut down.  Hundreds of crews were brought in from around the county to help restore the power outages.  In addition to damage caused by fallen trees and limbs, a lot of basement flooding occurred as power outages prevented sump pumps from working.  Clean up and repair costs for this storm were among the highest ever recorded for a natural disaster in Ohio.  Damage in many counties topped $1 million with a couple counties exceeding $10 million in losses.  In Richland County alone, clean up cost accrued by local governments totaled nearly $6 million.  Estimates indicate that as many as one million people lost power during this storm.  Several power companies reported the largest number of outages in their histories.  Hundreds if not thousands of homes and businesses were damaged by fallen trees, limbs and utility poles.",,"PDS"

Significant ice accumulations occurred over most of the area downing thousands of trees, causing widespread power outages and making travel nearly impossible.  Low pressure over Missouri moved rapidly northeast on January 5th.  This low moved across eastern Ohio early on January 6th and was responsible for producing a prolonged period of freezing rain.  A mixture of rain and snow changed to freezing rain from west to east during the early morning hours of the 5th.  Periods of freezing rain then continued for the remainder of the 5th and through the early morning hours of the 6th.  Temperatures eventually warmed enough during the late morning hours of the 6th to change the freezing rain back to rain.  The hardest hit  locations were west of Interstate 71 along the U.S. Route 30 corridor.  Ice accumulations of greater than three quarters of an inch were reported from Hancock County eastward across Wyandot, Crawford, Richland and Ashland Counties.  Northern sections of Wyandot and Marion Counties along with the southern halves of Seneca and Huron County were also hard hit.  Up to 80 percent of electric customers in these nine counties lost service during the storm, some for as much as ten days.  In cities like Mansfield, Bucyrus and Findlay, nearly every property in some neighborhoods sustained tree damage.  To the north and south of these areas ice accumulations ranged from one quarter to three quarters of an inch.  Counties closer to Lake Erie saw snow mix with the freezing rain at times which kept ice accumulations down to around one quarter inch and resulted in only scattered power outages.  A total of 3 to 5 inches of snow was also reported in these counties.  Ice build up at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant (Ottawa County) damaged the facility enough to force it to be temporarily shut down.  Hundreds of crews were brought in from around the county to help restore the power outages.  In addition to damage caused by fallen trees and limbs, a lot of basement flooding occurred as power outages prevented sump pumps from working.  Clean up and repair costs for this storm were among the highest ever recorded for a natural disaster in Ohio.  Damage in many counties topped $1 million with a couple counties exceeding $10 million in losses.  In Richland County alone, clean up cost accrued by local governments totaled nearly $6 million.  Estimates indicate that as many as one million people lost power during this storm.  Several power companies reported the largest number of outages in their histories.  Hundreds if not thousands of homes and businesses were damaged by fallen trees, limbs and utility poles.",,"PDS"

Systemwide 238,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power and the total repair cost was estimated at $25,000,000. Metropolitan Edison reported about 40,000 of its customers lost power. Thousands upon thousands of trees were knocked down or damaged. The number of outages cascaded.

Hardest hit locations was in the Pocono Plateau region in Carbon and Monroe Counties. States of emergencies were declared in both Carbon and Monroe Counties. Numerous roads were closed because of ice and downed trees. Firefighters had to clear roads to respond to emergencies. Unnecessary driving was not recommended. Many shelters were opened. The Red Cross served over 6,000 meals. Many hotels that had electricity were booked solid. Bottled water was distributed. While downed trees also caused power outages in the Lehigh Valley, it did not match the damage in the Poconos. Ironically precipitation started as plain rain before dawn on the 5th. It changed to freezing rain over the higher terrain of the Poconos during the first part of the morning and then changed to snow later that morning. Precipitation changed back to freezing rain around Midnight EST on the 6th in the Lehigh Valley and a bit after Midnight EST in the Poconos. Freezing rain also occurred in northern parts of Berks and Bucks Counties between Midnight EST and 7 a.m. EST on the 6th before precipitation changed back to plain rain. The change to plain rain worked its way north into the Lehigh Valley during the morning of the 6th, but precipitation remained freezing rain throughout most of the Poconos. Ice accretions in the Lehigh Valley averaged between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch and between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch in the Poconos.

That was followed by damage in Mahoning and Towamensing Townships. The Penn Forest Fire Company set a daily record for emergency responses. Entire boroughs and townships lost power. Telephone service was also lost in Penn Forest and Kidder Townships. U.S. Routes 309 and 209 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 54, 93 and 902 were all closed.

In Northampton County, Metropolitan Edison reported about 2,000 of its customers lost power. A state of emergency was declared in Upper Mount Bethel due to extensive power outages. Shelters were opened (three shelters were opened countywide).

Systemwide 238,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power and the total repair cost was estimated at $25,000,000. Metropolitan Edison reported about 40,000 of its customers lost power. Thousands upon thousands of trees were knocked down or damaged. The number of outages cascaded. There were only 1,000 the morning of the 6th, but that increased to 27,000 the afternoon of the 6th and 91,000 the evening of the 6th. There was only one direct injury from the storm, but a couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning trying to heat their powerless home. It took until January 16th for power to be completely restored. Hardest hit locations was in the Pocono Plateau region in Carbon and Monroe Counties. States of emergencies were declared in both Carbon and Monroe Counties. Numerous roads were closed because of ice and downed trees. Firefighters had to clear roads to respond to emergencies. Unnecessary driving was not recommended. Many shelters were opened. The Red Cross served over 6,000 meals. Many hotels that had electricity were booked solid. Bottled water was distributed. While downed trees also caused power outages in the Lehigh Valley, it did not match the damage in the Poconos. Ironically precipitation started as plain rain before dawn on the 5th. It changed to freezing rain over the higher terrain of the Poconos during the first part of the morning and then changed to snow later that morning. Precipitation changed back to freezing rain around Midnight EST on the 6th in the Lehigh Valley and a bit after Midnight EST in the Poconos. Freezing rain also occurred in northern parts of Berks and Bucks Counties between Midnight EST and 7 a.m. EST on the 6th before precipitation changed back to plain rain. The change to plain rain worked its way north into the Lehigh Valley during the morning of the 6th, but precipitation remained freezing rain throughout most of the Poconos. Ice accretions in the Lehigh Valley averaged between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch and between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch in the Poconos.  Snowfall accumulations in the Poconos were between one and three inches.  In Monroe County, a 57-year-old man and his 73-year-old companion died of carbon monoxide poisoning. They were running an gas-powered electrical generator in a garage beneath the home as well as two kerosene heaters. The fumes from the generator were not properly ventilated. Their pet cat also died. Dozens of others were taken to Pocono Medical Center with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. The only known injury was a 47-year-old PennDOT worker who was injured when a tree fell onto his truck and he injured his shoulder.  At least seventy trees fell on top of vehicles and homes. Emergency services in Monroe County responded to 1,300 calls on the 7th, the normal response number for an entire weekend. Schools were closed from the 5th through the 10th. All reopened on the 11th, except for the Pocono Mountain School District which did not re-open until the 12th. Many crashes occurred on Interstate 80. Too many roads were closed to keep track. Six major roads were still closed on the 7th. The Pocono Plateau was described as a war zone from Mount Pocono to Tobyhanna to Blakeslee. Fields were filled with downed trees and power lines. Even months later, the drive along Interstate 80 looks as though a large tornado sheared the tops from thousands of trees. The restoration efforts were thwarted by temperatures that did not get to the mid 30s in the Pocono Plateau until the 10th. About 32,000 homes and businesses still had no power on the 7th just as the next ice storm was starting. In Carbon County, the worst tree damage occurred in Penn Forest and Kidder Townships. That was followed by damage in Mahoning and Towamensing Townships. The Penn Forest Fire Company set a daily record for emergency responses. Entire boroughs and townships lost power. Telephone service was also lost in Penn Forest and Kidder Townships. U.S. Routes 309 and 209 as well as Pennsylvania State Routes 54, 93 and 902 were all closed.  It took until the 10th to have all of the major roads opened. Nine shelters were opened in fire stations, community centers and churches. schools were closed from the 5th through the 9th. Ironically, the impossible traveling conditions resulted in no reported traffic accidents in Kidder Township. Power was finally restored on the 16th to the hardest hit Indian Mountain Lakes, Towamensing Trails and Mount Pocohontas Developments in Penn Forest Township. In the Lehigh Valley, the worst conditions occurred at the northern end of the valley. In Lehigh County, all power was out in New Tripoli and the northern end of Washington Township. In Northampton County, Metropolitan Edison reported about 2,000 of its customers lost power. A state of emergency was declared in Upper Mount Bethel due to extensive power outages. Shelters were opened (three shelters were opened countywide). Downed trees and power outages were also reported in Bangor Borough, Plainfield Township, Bushkill Township, Wind Gap Borough, Pen Argyl Borough and Mount Bethel Township. Power outages were reported as far south as Nazareth. Snowfall accumulations included 3.0 inches in Pocono Summit (Monroe County) and 2.2 inches at the F.E. Walter Dam (Carbon County). Ice accretions included 0.75 of an inch in Tobyhanna (Monroe County), 0.5 of an inch in Albrightsville (Carbon County) and Heidelberg Township (Lehigh County) and 0.33 of an inch in Lehighton (Carbon County). The set was stage for the ice storm when a cold front moved through the region on the 4th. This allowed a cold air mass in the low levels to establish itself in the region. As a low pressure system moved east from the the Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley, it pushed warmer air aloft above this cold air mass. At the same time, a high pressure system slid across nearby Canada and kept a fresh supply of cold air near the surface. The low pressure system (which moved to Pittsburgh on the morning of the 6th) redeveloped along the Delmarva Peninsula later that day as the cold air remained wedged in place. Precipitation aloft fell as rain, but the high pressure system in nearby Canada kept that fresh supply of cold air that had the rain fall as freezing rain throughout the heart of the event.",,"PDS"

Snow began during the late morning of the 28th around the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area and spread north and reached the Poconos during the early afternoon. Heavier bands of accumulating snow moved through the eastern part of the state during the afternoon and evening of the 28th. The snow ended across the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area before the sun rose on March 1st and ended during the morning in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos. Accumulations averaged 6 to 12 inches. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies. Many schools dismissed children early on the 28th, a few cancelled classes altogether. Some employers let their workers go home early. Many state offices closed at 1 p.m. EST on the 28th. About 30 percent of all flights from Philadelphia International Airport were cancelled. Untreated roads became slippery especially as the afternoon and evening wore on and temperatures dropped. Many after school activities and classes as well as municipal and school board meetings were cancelled. Many schools had delayed openings on March 1st. In Carbon County, schools were closed on March 1st.The snow and slippery roads led to several serious accidents on major roadways. In Philadelphia, the eastbound Schuylkill Expressway was closed during the latter part of the evening commute at the University Avenue exit after a four vehicle accident. On the Vine Street Expressway, a paratransit bus was involved in an accident and several serious injuries ensued. In Northampton County, westbound Interstate 78 was closed for most of the evening after two tractor-trailers collided. In Nazareth (Northampton County), a vehicle struck a utility pole and caused outages to 1,000 homes and businesses. Similarly, about 1,000 homes and businesses in northwestern Reading (Berks County) lost power after a vehicle struck another utility pole. Dozens of accidents occurred throughout Berks, Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton Counties.

During the 5 day event, rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 10 inches over coastal areas with up to 32 inches in the mountains. With such copious rainfall, flash flooding was a serious problem across Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. In Santa Barbara county, flash flooding and mudslides closed Gibraltar Road at Mt. Calvary Road, stranding several vehicles, while mudslides inundated 3 homes in Lake Casitas. Across Ventura county, flash flooding and mudslides closed down Creek Road at Hermosa Road. In addition, the Ventura Beach RV Resort was flooded and Highways 1 and 126 were closed due to flooding. Across Los Angeles county, flash flooding killed a homeless man in Elysian Park, flooded a mobile home park in Santa Clarita, closed Highway 1 and caused numerous problems in Palmdale. In the mountains, 4 to 12 feet of snowfall was recorded along with southeast winds between 30 and 50 MPH with higher gusts. Across the Central Coast and in the Salinas River Valley, high winds gusting to 65 MPH knocked down numerous trees and power lines. In La Conchita, a devastating mudslide killed 10 people, destroyed 15 homes and damaged 12 other homes.

The snow was caused by a combination of factors: a low pressure system that moved off the southeastern Atlantic Coast on the morning of the 4th, an upper air disturbance that moved through the lower Delmarva Peninsula the same morning and some of the moisture that backed its way from the central Atlantic Ocean. This moisture was associated with the winter storm that mainly affected the Delmarva on January 29th and 30th. Untreated roadways were slippery, especially in Monmouth County. As daylight began on the 4th, additional snow had a difficult time accumulating. In fact precipitation ended as light rain in southeastern New Jersey.

The snow ended across the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area before the sun rose on March 1st and ended during the morning in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos. Accumulations averaged 6 to 12 inches. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies. Many schools dismissed children early on the 28th, a few cancelled classes altogether. Some employers let their workers go home early. Many state offices closed at 1 p.m. EST on the 28th. About 30 percent of all flights from Philadelphia International Airport were cancelled.

In Philadelphia, the eastbound Schuylkill Expressway was closed during the latter part of the evening commute at the University Avenue exit after a four vehicle accident. On the Vine Street Expressway, a paratransit bus was involved in an accident and several serious injuries ensued. In Northampton County, westbound Interstate 78 was closed for most of the evening after two tractor-trailers collided. In Nazareth (Northampton County), a vehicle struck a utility pole and caused outages to 1,000 homes and businesses. Similarly, about 1,000 homes and businesses in northwestern Reading (Berks County) lost power after a vehicle struck another utility pole.
