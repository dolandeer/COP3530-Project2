(per the U.S. Drought Monitor: http://www.drought.unl.edu/dm/monitor.html) ||Near to slightly above normal soil moisture was observed across all of South Texas by the end of December.  Supplemental feeding of hay for livestock continued to decline.  Pecan harvesting was actually slowed due to the rain.  Most cattle remained in good condition.  Wheat and oats progressed from fair to good condition because of the light rains and cool temperatures.  Cool season grasses looked good and the fire |danger remained low during the month. ||Reservoir levels for the Corpus Christi and Victoria water supply either rose or remained nearly steady during the month.  Choke Canyon Reservoir was near 68% capacity and Lake Corpus Christi near 33% capacity by the end of the month.","CSV"

The heaviest snowfall observed across extreme eastern Kansas was 8 inches in Atchison.||A review of the snow storm archives found this storm unusual in that it was the first snow storm that blizzard conditions were reported - wind speeds of 35 mph greater and wind-driven snow reducing visibilities to 1/4 mile or less sustained for three hours or more - to affect the forecast domain of the National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill, Missouri since the office opened in the 1992.  Though observed snowfall in the 10 to 14 inch range is uncommon, there have been several instances that snow amounts of these magnitudes have been observed in the past 15 years.  What is unusual is the combination of heavy snow and wind speeds exceeding 35 mph.  Since record keeping began, only five other instances have been recorded in which blizzard or near-blizzard conditions have impacted the forecast area for which the National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill has responsibility: February 5, 1924,  December 31, 1978-January 1, 1979,  December 1-2, 1985, January 18, 1996 and January 27, 1996.","Seven to eight inches of snow was observed across northern portions of the county.|Drifts of up to 4 feet were reported.","CSV"

Strong winds not along allowed the snow bands to extend well inland, but produced significantly reduced visibilities in blowing and drifting snow. The Lake Erie snows produced significant accumulations well into the Rochester metro area. Off Lake Erie, the event began in a southwest across northern Erie and southern Niagara counties, and then settled south into southern Erie and Wyoming counties by mid morning Thursday (10th) after dropping 2 to 4 inches. A short wave then approached and lifted the band northward for several hours during the day across the metro Buffalo area and across Genesee and Monroe counties, then settled slowly south and stalled out for many hours during the evening 10th with very intense snowfall rates across the Buffalo south towns and Wyoming county. This band also dropped down across the lakeshore areas of Chautauqua county with intense rates with major implications on the NYS Thruway. The NYS thruway was closed between Dunkirk and the PA line with hundreds of motorists stranded. The activity dropped further south and set up across the southern tier counties for much of Friday (11th) before drier air advected in during the evening. The activity weakened and ended by midnight. Specific snowfall amounts included: Springville 27 inches; Perrysburg 24 inches; Colden and Arcade 23 inches; Warsaw 22 inches; East Aurora and Batavia 17 inches; West Seneca 13 inches; and Buffalo and Rochester 3 to 9 inches (from north to south).|Off Lake Ontario, a similar scenario ensued, several hours later. The band initially set up in the Watertown area Thursday morning and slowly settled south later Thursday into early Friday (11th) with intense rates across southern Jefferson and central Lewis counties. The band then settled further into southern Lewis and Oswego counties later Friday as winds veered a bit further before weakening Saturday morning as the drier air advected in. Specific snowfall amounts included: Highmarket 40 inches; Port Leyden 37 inches; Lowville 30 inches; Redfield 28 inches; Copenhagen 21 inches; Carthage 15 inches; and Watertown 11 inches.","","CSV"

The snow transitioned to lake effect snow that night, and lasted into the 11th in some of the snowbelts.  Localized 4 to 8 inch accumulations were common in a given 12 hour period.  There was a considerable amount of wind, and thus blowing and drifting snow, especially on the 9th.  Gaylord had its 2nd largest three-day snowfall since 1950, with 21.8 inches.  Almost all school districts were closed on the 9th, and some schools called off classes for three consecutive days.","","CSV"

The storm was driven by an upper level disturbance that tracked from the west coast across the Rockies and deepened over the Mississippi River valley.  The heaviest snow fell in advance of when the stronger winds arrived, mainly during the morning and afternoon of Dec. 8th.  However, as the winds increased to 30 to 50 mph during the night of the 8th and early on the 9th, visibilities frequently dropped to near zero, especially in open areas.  Considerable drifting snow also occurred, in many cases closing roads back shut almost as fast as they could be opened.  This prompted many counties to pull snow plows off the roads for a while during the night of the 8th and 9th.  Many schools were closed for 3 days because of the storm, due the forecast of heavy snow to begin on the 7th, poor visibilities and roads drifted shut on the 8th and still some closed roads and bitter cold wind chills which followed the storm on the 9th.||Total snowfall from the storm was 6 to 15 inches over most of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Higher amounts in eastern Nebraska included 15 inches in Union, 14 inches in Columbus, around 12 inches at the NWS in Valley, at Tekamah, Uehling, Steele City and Weeping Water.  In western Iowa heavier amounts included 12 inches in Clarinda and Hastings and around 11 inches in Harlan, Red Oak and Little Sioux.","Snowfall of 8 to 12 inches fell across much of the county from this storm with 10 inches measured in Shenandoah. The snow began during the late evening of 12/7 and continued into the early morning hours of 12/9.  Winds were not that strong when the snow started, but north winds increased during the afternoon of 12/8 and especially that evening into the next morning.  Frequent wind gusts of 40 mph or so were observed with a peak gust of 44 mph measured at Shenandoah.  The winds produced considerable blowing and drifting snow with blizzard conditions during the evening and early morning hours of the 8th and 9th, which closed many county roads.","CSV"

The storm was driven by an upper level disturbance that tracked from the west coast across the Rockies and deepened over the Mississippi River valley.  The heaviest snow fell in advance of when the stronger winds arrived, mainly during the morning and afternoon of Dec. 8th.  However, as the winds increased to 30 to 50 mph during the night of the 8th and early on the 9th, visibilities frequently dropped to near zero, especially in open areas.  Considerable drifting snow also occurred, in many cases closing roads back shut almost as fast as they could be opened.  This prompted many counties to pull snow plows off the roads for a while during the night of the 8th and 9th.  Many schools were closed for 3 days because of the storm, due the forecast of heavy snow to begin on the 7th, poor visibilities and roads drifted shut on the 8th and still some closed roads and bitter cold wind chills which followed the storm on the 9th.||Total snowfall from the storm was 6 to 15 inches over most of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Higher amounts in eastern Nebraska included 15 inches in Union, 14 inches in Columbus, around 12 inches at the NWS in Valley, at Tekamah, Uehling, Steele City and Weeping Water.  In western Iowa heavier amounts included 12 inches in Clarinda and Hastings and around 11 inches in Harlan, Red Oak and Little Sioux.","Snowfall of 8 to 12 inches fell across much of the county from this storm with 11.3 inches measured in Red Oak. The snow began during the late evening of 12/7 and continued into the early morning hours of 12/9.  Winds were not that strong when the snow started, but north winds increased during the afternoon of 12/8 and especially that evening into the next morning.  Frequent wind gusts of 35 to 40 mph were observed with a peak gust measured at 40 mph Red Oak.  The winds produced considerable blowing and drifting snow with blizzard conditions during the evening and early morning hours of the 8th and 9th, which closed many county roads.","CSV"

The storm was driven by an upper level disturbance that tracked from the west coast across the Rockies and deepened over the Mississippi River valley.  The heaviest snow fell in advance of when the stronger winds arrived, mainly during the morning and afternoon of Dec. 8th.  However, as the winds increased to 30 to 50 mph during the night of the 8th and early on the 9th, visibilities frequently dropped to near zero, especially in open areas.  Considerable drifting snow also occurred, in many cases closing roads back shut almost as fast as they could be opened.  This prompted many counties to pull snow plows off the roads for a while during the night of the 8th and 9th.  Many schools were closed for 3 days because of the storm, due the forecast of heavy snow to begin on the 7th, poor visibilities and roads drifted shut on the 8th and still some closed roads and bitter cold wind chills which followed the storm on the 9th.||Total snowfall from the storm was 6 to 15 inches over most of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Higher amounts in eastern Nebraska included 15 inches in Union, 14 inches in Columbus, around 12 inches at the NWS in Valley, at Tekamah, Uehling, Steele City and Weeping Water.  In western Iowa heavier amounts included 12 inches in Clarinda and Hastings and around 11 inches in Harlan, Red Oak and Little Sioux.","Snowfall of 8 to 12 inches fell across much of the county from this storm with 10 inches measured in Onawa and 8.3 inches at Mapleton.  The snow began shortly after midnight on 12/7 and continued into the early morning hours of 12/9.  Winds were not that strong when the snow started, but north winds increased during the afternoon of 12/8 and especially that evening into the next morning.  Frequent wind gusts of 40 mph or more were observed based on measurements from surrounding counties.  The winds produced considerable blowing and drifting snow with blizzard conditions during the evening and early morning hours of the 8th and 9th, which closed many county roads.","CSV"

The heaviest snow fell in advance of when the stronger winds arrived, mainly during the morning and afternoon of Dec. 8th.  However, as the winds increased to 30 to 50 mph during the night of the 8th and early on the 9th, visibilities frequently dropped to near zero, especially in open areas.  Considerable drifting snow also occurred, in many cases closing roads back shut almost as fast as they could be opened.  This prompted many counties to pull snow plows off the roads for a while during the night of the 8th and 9th.

In western Iowa heavier amounts included 12 inches in Clarinda and Hastings and around 11 inches in Harlan, Red Oak and Little Sioux.","Snowfall of 8 to 12 inches fell across much of the county from this storm with 11 inches measured in Harlan. The snow began during the late evening of 12/7 and continued into the early morning hours of 12/9.  Winds were not that strong when the snow started, but north winds increased during the afternoon of 12/8 and especially that evening into the next morning.  Frequent wind gusts of 40 mph or more were observed with a peak gust of 48 mph measured in Harlan.

The storm was driven by an upper level disturbance that tracked from the west coast across the Rockies and deepened over the Mississippi River valley.  The heaviest snow fell in advance of when the stronger winds arrived, mainly during the morning and afternoon of Dec. 8th.  However, as the winds increased to 30 to 50 mph during the night of the 8th and early on the 9th, visibilities frequently dropped to near zero, especially in open areas.  Considerable drifting snow also occurred, in many cases closing roads back shut almost as fast as they could be opened.  This prompted many counties to pull snow plows off the roads for a while during the night of the 8th and 9th.

Higher amounts in eastern Nebraska included 15 inches in Union, 14 inches in Columbus, around 12 inches at the NWS in Valley, at Tekamah, Uehling, Steele City and Weeping Water.  In western Iowa heavier amounts included 12 inches in Clarinda and Hastings and around 11 inches in Harlan, Red Oak and Little Sioux.","Snowfall of 8 to 12 inches fell across much of the county from this storm with 10.4 inches measured near Little Sioux and 8.5 inches measured at Logan.  The snow began during the late evening of 12/7 and continued into the early morning hours of 12/9.  Winds were not that strong when the snow started, but north winds increased during the afternoon of 12/8 and especially that evening into the next morning.  Frequent wind gusts of 40 mph or so were observed based on observations from surrounding sites.  The winds produced considerable blowing and drifting snow with blizzard conditions during the evening and early morning hours of the 8th and 9th, which closed many county roads.","CSV"

Lake Erie had a large amount of ice but the snow apparently formed off some open water north of Long Point. Over 6 fell in this narrow strip with plenty of blowing snow and near whiteout conditions just to the south of the city which snarled the evening rush hour. The activity weakened during the evening and lifted north across the Buffalo metro area and dropped a quick 1-3 inches early Saturday before dissipating. Reported snowfalls included: 12 inches at Perrsyburg; 10 inches at Elma, 9 inches in East Aurora; and 7 inches at Alden.|Off Lake Ontario, the activity was stronger as ice was not a factor. Bands developed early Friday over northern Cayuga and southwest Oswego counties and gradually meandered northward during Friday and Friday night, with several intense bands setting up across the area from Pulaski to Watertown. This continued through much of Saturday before weakening during the afternoon in the Watertown area, but not before nearly two feet fell.

The storm was driven by an upper level disturbance that tracked from the west coast across the Rockies and deepened over the Mississippi River valley.  The heaviest snow fell in advance of when the stronger winds arrived, mainly during the morning and afternoon of Dec. 8th.  However, as the winds increased to 30 to 50 mph during the night of the 8th and early on the 9th, visibilities frequently dropped to near zero, especially in open areas.  Considerable drifting snow also occurred, in many cases closing roads back shut almost as fast as they could be opened.  This prompted many counties to pull snow plows off the roads for a while during the night of the 8th and 9th.  Many schools were closed for 3 days because of the storm, due the forecast of heavy snow to begin on the 7th, poor visibilities and roads drifted shut on the 8th and still some closed roads and bitter cold wind chills which followed the storm on the 9th.||Total snowfall from the storm was 6 to 15 inches over most of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Higher amounts in eastern Nebraska included 15 inches in Union, 14 inches in Columbus, around 12 inches at the NWS in Valley, at Tekamah, Uehling, Steele City and Weeping Water.  In western Iowa heavier amounts included 12 inches in Clarinda and Hastings and around 11 inches in Harlan, Red Oak and Little Sioux.","Snowfall of 8 to 12 inches fell across much of the county from this storm with 12 inches measured in Clarinda and 10 inches measured in Shenandoah. The snow began during the late evening of 12/7 and continued into the early morning hours of 12/9.  Winds were not that strong when the snow started, but north winds increased during the afternoon of 12/8 and especially that evening into the next morning.  Frequent wind gusts of 40 mph or so were observed with a peak gust of 44 mph measured at Shenandoah and 40 mph at Clarinda.  The winds produced considerable blowing and drifting snow with visibilities frequently below 1/4 mile during the early morning hours of the 9th.  The blowing and drifting snow also closed many county roads.","CSV"

Lake Erie had a large amount of ice but the snow apparently formed off some open water north of Long Point. Over 6 fell in this narrow strip with plenty of blowing snow and near whiteout conditions just to the south of the city which snarled the evening rush hour. The activity weakened during the evening and lifted north across the Buffalo metro area and dropped a quick 1-3 inches early Saturday before dissipating. Reported snowfalls included: 12 inches at Perrsyburg; 10 inches at Elma, 9 inches in East Aurora; and 7 inches at Alden.|Off Lake Ontario, the activity was stronger as ice was not a factor. Bands developed early Friday over northern Cayuga and southwest Oswego counties and gradually meandered northward during Friday and Friday night, with several intense bands setting up across the area from Pulaski to Watertown.

The storm was driven by an upper level disturbance that tracked from the west coast across the Rockies and deepened over the Mississippi River valley.  The heaviest snow fell in advance of when the stronger winds arrived, mainly during the morning and afternoon of Dec. 8th.  However, as the winds increased to 30 to 50 mph during the night of the 8th and early on the 9th, visibilities frequently dropped to near zero, especially in open areas.  Considerable drifting snow also occurred, in many cases closing roads back shut almost as fast as they could be opened.  This prompted many counties to pull snow plows off the roads for a while during the night of the 8th and 9th.  Many schools were closed for 3 days because of the storm, due the forecast of heavy snow to begin on the 7th, poor visibilities and roads drifted shut on the 8th and still some closed roads and bitter cold wind chills which followed the storm on the 9th.||Total snowfall from the storm was 6 to 15 inches over most of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Higher amounts in eastern Nebraska included 15 inches in Union, 14 inches in Columbus, around 12 inches at the NWS in Valley, at Tekamah, Uehling, Steele City and Weeping Water.  In western Iowa heavier amounts included 12 inches in Clarinda and Hastings and around 11 inches in Harlan, Red Oak and Little Sioux.","Snowfall of 8 to 12 inches fell across much of the county from this storm with 12 inches measured in Clarinda and 10 inches measured in Shenandoah. The snow began during the late evening of 12/7 and continued into the early morning hours of 12/9.  Winds were not that strong when the snow started, but north winds increased during the afternoon of 12/8 and especially that evening into the next morning.  Frequent wind gusts of 40 mph or so were observed with a peak gust of 44 mph measured at Shenandoah and 40 mph at Clarinda.  The winds produced considerable blowing and drifting snow with blizzard conditions during the evening and early morning hours of the 8th and 9th, which closed many county roads.","CSV"

This was the 3rd time since late December that extensive lowland flooding occurred along the Wabash. The March flood exceeded the previous two floods from Lafayette to just downstream of Terre Haute on the Wabash River.||The biggest problem caused by the flood along the Wabash was the inconvenience to local traffic that normally used State Road 43, State Road 225 and local roads in the Grandville Bridge area. The flood also caused disruption to the construction of a natural gas pipeline going from the Rocky Mountains to the east coast. This was third delay in three months to construction of the pipeline underneath the Wabash in the Montezuma area.","Extensive flooding occurred along the Wabash River in and near Covington, IN.

Flood crests were similar to those|of February 2008.||Many local river residents listened to the Carroll County EMA director about the potential for serious flooding and voluntarily left their homes on the 9th and 10th.

Strong warming in the south end of the San Joaquin Valley gave Bakersfield a record high of 86 degrees, which almost was the warmest day of the month at Meadows Field. The low drew subtropical moisture into interior central California from the southwest, bringing rain and high-elevation snow to the region. In Yosemite National Park, a foot of new snow fell at Tuolumne Meadows during the night of March 2nd-3rd.|Colder air moved into the region during the 3rd as a slow moving cold front dropped south. The high at Fresno dropped from 67 on the 3rd to only 59 on the 4th, and Bakersfield���s high fell 13 degrees���from 74 on the 3rd to only 61 the next day. More snow fell over the Southern Sierra Nevada beginning the night of March 3rd and continuing through the 4th. Estimated snowfalls at SNOTEL sites ranged from 15 inches to around 2 feet. With a cold, unstable airmass over the San Joaquin Valley, conditions were right for thunderstorms to form over the west side of the San Joaquin Valley during the afternoon and evening of March 4th.|The trough pulled east of California during the morning of March 7th. This system brought the bulk of March���s precipitation to central California, with Fresno having a storm total of 0.18 inch, and Bakersfield receiving 0.20 inch. With the moist lower levels of the airmass over the San Joaquin Valley, patchy fog developed during the morning hours of the 7th.","","CSV"

The flood also caused disruption to the construction of a natural gas pipeline going from the Rocky Mountains to the east coast. This was third delay in three months to construction of the pipeline underneath the Wabash in the Montezuma area.","Extensive flooding of agricultural land occurred along the Wabash River in Parke County in and near Montezuma, IN.

The mid level speed max near the base of the trough axis, combined with strong mixing, resulted in high winds across the Guadalupe and Davis Mountains of west Texas during the afternoon hours.  Although the surface winds were also strong across the plains due to a tight pressure gradient from a lee low, they did not reach high wind criteria.","","CSV"

Deep dry adiabatic layers resulted in maximum mixing potential, which allowed the stronger winds to mix down to the surface.  The 700 hPa gradient over the area on this day suggested the potential for high winds was high, especially over the higher terrain of west Texas.","","CSV"
