However, in northern Oklahoma the drought deteriorated to exceptional (D4) drought conditions by the end of the month.|The drought that has lasted for more than a year continued to cause water concerns for many communities. Many communities had limited watering activities along with a concern over the availability of adequate drinking water. The low water levels also continued to affect outdoor recreation. Many boat docks and ramps remained on dry ground. Boaters who were able to get in the water also had to be careful due to the lakebed being closer to the surface. This led to the closure of several lakes due to safety concerns. Outdoor recreation activities such as hunting were also affected due to the wildlife dealing with the lack of water and proper vegetation for food.|The agriculture industry continued to be hit hard by the drought. Hay crop was small which led to many ranchers and farmers selling all or part of livestock herds due to the lack of food. The cotton crop was affected by the heat and drought of the summer months. There was also concern that the lack of adequate moisture will affect other future crops that were planted during the fall such as winter wheat.|The dry conditions combined with wind caused the spread of several wildfires. Several firefighter departments helped to fight a fire near Guthrie that closed Interstate 35 southbound near mile marker 165 for a time. The fire burned several hundred acres. Another fire occurred near Ponca City. Several fires were reported near Mangum and Granite when high winds downed power lines which sparked the dry vegetation.","","CSV"

The trough resulted in widespread high winds over the region, where intense short-term drought conditions existed. The wind combined with the exceptionally dry conditions to result in a historic outbreak of wildfires over eastern New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma.High and frequently severe winds began to blow over the west Texas South Plains by late morning. These winds persisted through the mid afternoon hours, and resulted in widespread blowing dust and one injury. At least a dozen wind-driven wildfires were sparked over the South Plains. Four of the wildfires were significant, and resulted in the loss of property and three injuries. The winds and fires on the 1st combined to result in four injuries and estimated property losses that exceeded $350,000 .",,"PDS"

The high tide in Philadelphia reached 8.44 feet above mean lower low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water. The tidal flooding was caused by the east to northeast flow between a low pressure system that moved west to east across the central part of the United States and a high pressure system that skirted across southeastern Canada. The low pressure system moved from northeastern Missouri around sunrise on the 2nd into Indiana during the evening of the 2nd and Ohio around daybreak on the 3rd. A secondary low pressure system formed along its warm frontal boundary on the Delmarva Peninsula early in the morning on the 3rd and moved east fairly rapidly.

Monthly totals and departures varied widely by location.  For example, in Burlington, Iowa, the monthly total was 2.73 inches or 1.42 inches above normal and 208% of normal.  In the other hand, in Dubuque, Iowa, the monthly total was 1.32 inches or 0.04 inches above normal and 103% of normal.  Precipitation for most of the month was light to moderate.  The exception was toward the end of the month when a storm system brought significant rainfall amounts to the HSA from the 28th-30th.  Precipitation totals ranged from around 1 inch in the west to over 2 inches in the east.  Because of the warm temperatures, most of the precipitation fell as rain.  The majority of the rain fell on the 28th over a 24-hour period.

Again, because of the warm temperatures, the precipitation fell as rain.  Amounts were greatest on the Iowa and Missouri side of the Mississippi River.

A few locations reported above normal (76th to 90th percentile) conditions and a few locations reported below normal (10th to 24th percentile) conditions.  The precipitation event on the 2nd resulted in increases in stream flows especially in Iowa and Missouri.  Stream flows went to above to much above normal (greater than 90th percentile) there, but were below to much below normal (less than 10th percentile) across Illinois.  These conditions persisted through the 15th.After the 15th stream flows across the entire HSA gradually became near to below normal.  The flows remained this way until the 28th when significant liquid precipitation fell across the entire HSA.  In response to this precipitation, stream flows became above to much above normal.

Many communities had limited watering activities along with a concern over the availability of adequate drinking water. The low water levels also continued to affect outdoor recreation. Many boat docks and ramps remained on dry ground. Boaters who were able to get in the water also had to be careful due to the lakebed being closer to the surface. This led to the closure of several lakes due to safety concerns. Outdoor recreation activities such as hunting were also affected due to the wildlife dealing with the lack of water and proper vegetation for food.|The agriculture industry continued to be hit hard by the drought. Hay crop was small which led to many ranchers and farmers selling all or part of livestock herds due to the lack of food. The cotton crop was affected by the heat and drought of the summer months. There was also concern that the lack of adequate moisture will affect other future crops that were planted during the fall such as winter wheat.|The dry conditions combined with wind caused the spread of several wildfires.

Drought levels ranged from severe to exceptional (D2-D4), with the driest conditions in southeast Oklahoma. Some precipitation did fall during the month, mainly in the form of snow, which did not do much to alleviate the dry conditions over the area. The new year started off with a bang with a major wildfire event occurring across the area on New Year's Day due to strong winds, some gusting over 50 mph, and low humidities. The biggest fire occurred in Kingfisher county where more than 31,360 across were burned. Another large fire occurred on January 1st in the Arbuckle Mountains of Murray county where 18,000 acres were scorched. Many federal, state, tribal, and local assets along with assistance from other states were used to fight the fires. The metropolitan area of Oklahoma City was not immune to the wildfires. Several fires ignited across the city. The largest urban wildfire affected the northeastern parts of the metro, where several neighborhoods were threatened and many residents were evacuated. Numerous structures were burned, but no injuries occurred. Overall, the wildfires across the western half of Oklahoma injured several firefighters due to smoke inhalation and minor burns, but no fatalities were reported. In all, over 55,000 acres were scorched across western and central Oklahoma on New Year's Day. Numerous structures, including many homes, were burned along with many large round hay bales which were desperately needed to sustain livestock through the drought. A Federal Emergency Declaration was declared for many of the affected counties.January 12 was another day of many wildfires across the area. Strong winds exacerbated already dry conditions. One of the largest wildfires occurred near Ratliff City in Carter county where 23,380 acres of land were scorched. The fire burned an area about 9 miles long and was at times 4.5 miles wide. Twenty homes and 3 mobile homes were destroyed. Two oil field offices, 9 garages, and 10 outbuildings were also destroyed. Two hundred round bales of hay were burned. Thirty-five head of cattle were also killed. One tank battery also caught fire which caused a hazmat incident. Four towns of approximately 800 homes were evacuated due to this fire.Many other days saw wildfires in the area. More than 110,000 acres were scorched during the month of January destroying many structures, including homes. The drought also continued to affect farm ponds and livestock across the area, with many ranchers and farmers selling their entire herd due to scorched pasture and hay, and lack of water.","PDS"

Accumulations averaged 1 to 3 inches and ice accretions averaged around one-quarter of an inch. Precipitation started as snow around Midnight EST on the 23rd. Precipitation changed to freezing rain between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. EST on the 23rd and was in the process of changing to plain rain by 6 a.m. EST in the lower terrain locations and throughout most of Morris County. The change to plain rain spread throughout the area by the middle of the morning. The rain ended during the afternoon. Prior to the changeover, untreated roads were slippery.  Specific accumulations included 2.6 inches in Wantage (Sussex County), 2.5 inches in Butler (Morris County) and 2.0 inches in Highland Lake (Sussex County) and Blairstown (Warren County). Ice accretions generally averaged around one-quarter of an inch in the higher terrain locations of Warren and Sussex Counties. The winter storm was caused by a fast moving low pressure system that developed over the Gulf of Mexico. The high pressure system was over the region on the 22nd and moved east into the New England coastal waters by the morning of the 23rd. This is normally not a favorable position for freezing rain. In this instance precipitation moved into the region so quickly and overnight, that the cold air near the surface could not get scoured.

The highest tides occurred during the morning along the ocean and the spread up Delaware  Bay around noon EST and into the Delaware River and tidal sections of its tributaries during the first half of the afternoon. The tide reached 7.1 feet above mean lower low water at Breakwater Harbor (Sussex County).  Minor tidal flooding begins at 6.7 feet above mean lower low water. The tide reached 7.44 feet above mean lower low water at Reedy Island (New Castle County). Minor tidal flooding starts at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water. The low pressure system that caused the minor tidal flooding formed along the Virginia coast during the early morning on the 31st. By 7 a.m. EST on the 31st it had deepened to a 995 millibar low pressure system. It then moved slowly northeast as it intensified. At 1 p.m. EST that afternoon it had deepened to 990 millibars and was located about 200 miles east of the Delaware coast and at 7 p.m. EST that evening, it had deepened to 976 millibars, but was already about 200 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

These winds persisted through the mid afternoon hours, and resulted in widespread blowing dust and one injury. At least a dozen wind-driven wildfires were sparked over the South Plains. Four of the wildfires were significant, and resulted in the loss of property and three injuries.

The exception was toward the end of the month when a storm system brought significant rainfall amounts to the HSA from the 28th-30th.  Precipitation totals ranged from around 1 inch in the west to over 2 inches in the east.  Because of the warm temperatures, most of the precipitation fell as rain.

Monthly totals and departures varied widely by location.  For example, in Burlington, Iowa, the monthly total was 2.73 inches or 1.42 inches above normal and 208% of normal.  In the other hand, in Dubuque, Iowa, the monthly total was 1.32 inches or 0.04 inches above normal and 103% of normal.  Precipitation for most of the month was light to moderate.

The trough resulted in widespread high winds over the region, where intense short-term drought conditions existed. The wind combined with the exceptionally dry conditions to result in a historic outbreak of wildfires over eastern New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma.High and frequently severe winds began to blow over the west Texas South Plains by late morning. These winds persisted through the mid afternoon hours, and resulted in widespread blowing dust and one injury. At least a dozen wind-driven wildfires were sparked over the South Plains. Four of the wildfires were significant, and resulted in the loss of property and three injuries. The winds and fires on the 1st combined to result in four injuries and estimated property losses that exceeded $350,000 .",,"PDS"

The high tide in Phialdelphia reached 8.44 feet above mean lwoer low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water. The tidal flooding was caused by the east to northeast flow between a low pressure system that moved west to east across the central part of the United States and a high pressure system that skirted across southeastern Canada. The low pressure system moved from northeastern Missouri around sunrise on the 2nd into Indiana during the evening of the 2nd and Ohio around daybreak on the 3rd.

The U.S. Drought Monitor included more of the North Texas in the Extreme Drought (D3) category by the end of November than in the previous month, but did eliminate the Exceptional Drought (D4) area from North Texas.|Areas which did receive rainfall experienced reduced fire danger.  Hydrologic deficits remained extremely high, with almost every lake well below conservation levels.  The worst included Lake Bridgeport at over seventeen feet below normal, and Lake Grapevine at twelve feet below normal.  Stage 1 water restrictions remained in effect in most metroplex counties. |The Drought Impact Reporter reported that hay prices in Texas were approximately twice what they were before the drought began this month. Crops continued to suffer, with the cotton production this year about half of last year���s crop.","","CSV"

The high tide in Philadelphia reached 8.44 feet above mean lower low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water. The tidal flooding was caused by the east to northeast flow between a low pressure system that moved west to east across the central part of the United States and a high pressure system that skirted across southeastern Canada. The low pressure system moved from northeastern Missouri around sunrise on the 2nd into Indiana during the evening of the 2nd and Ohio around daybreak on the 3rd. A secondary low pressure system formed along its warm frontal boundary on the Delmarva Peninsula early in the morning on the 3rd and moved east fairly rapidly.

Snow accumulations reached around eight inches in the higher terrain of Sussex County and ice accretions reached one-quarter of an inch in Sussex and Warren Counties. Untreated roads were hazardous. Precipitation actually started as light rain during the afternoon on the 2nd. But as its intensity increased and colder air filtered south, it changed over to sleet and snow during the late afternoon. Precipitation then changed back to rain in the valleys and freezing rain in the higher terrain of Sussex and Warren Counties. Precipitation by that point was mainly rain in Morris County. Precipitation then changed back to snow during the early morning of the 3rd and ended during the afternoon of the 3rd. Accumulations included 8.5 inches at High Point State Park (Sussex County), 8.0 inches in Wantage (Sussex County), 7.8 inches in Highland Lakes (Sussex County), 5.5 inches in Montague (Sussex County), 4.0 inches in Newton (Sussex County), 3.0 inches in Blairstown (Warren County), 2.3 inches in Marcella (Morris County) and 2.0 inches in Belvidere (Warren County) and Butler (Morris County). The wintry weather was caused by a low pressure system that moved west to east across the central part of the United States. In tandem, a high pressure system skirted across southeastern Canada and kept a fresh supply of cold air near the surface. The low pressure system moved from northeastern Missouri around sunrise on the 2nd into Indiana during the evening of the 2nd and Ohio around daybreak on the 3rd. A secondary low pressure system formed along its warm frontal boundary on the Delmarva Peninsula early in the morning on the 3rd and moved east fairly rapidly.

The high tide at Reedy Island (New Castle County in Delaware) reached 7.29 feet above mean lower low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water. The high tide in Phialdelphia reached 8.44 feet above mean lwoer low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water. The tidal flooding was caused by the east to northeast flow between a low pressure system that moved west to east across the central part of the United States and a high pressure system that skirted across southeastern Canada. The low pressure system moved from northeastern Missouri around sunrise on the 2nd into Indiana during the evening of the 2nd and Ohio around daybreak on the 3rd. A secondary low pressure system formed along its warm frontal boundary on the Delmarva Peninsula early in the morning on the 3rd and moved east fairly rapidly. By 7 p.m. EST on the 3rd it was already about 400 miles east of Atlantic City.  While the low pressure system moved well offshore by the morning of the 4th, the high pressure system built south into northern New England. This maintained a weaker, (but still) up the bay flow and helped cause pockets of minor tidal flooding with the daytime high tide cycle.",,"PDS"

A warm front was pushing through West Virginia at the time, triggering showers and rare early morning January thunderstorms.  Predawn temperatures were in the 40s.  Sensors from the National Lightning Detection Network indicated a few cloud to ground strikes in the vicinity.  A strong positively charge bolt occurred around 0626E, followed a few seconds later by a minor seismic event.  Local residents reported that their houses shook.  The U.S. Geological Survey Advanced National Seismic System sensor at Mont Chateau along Cheat Lake near Morgantown, recorded the event most clearly.  The initial underground blast may have killed one coal miner. Twelve other miners were trapped in the mine after the explosion.  Eleven of those miners were likely asphyxiated by carbon monoxide, as they waited to be rescued.  One of the younger miners survived more than 36 hours in the mine, and was hospitalized.    Lightning was being investigated as the most likely cause of the initial ignition.  If so, then 12 deaths can be indirectly attributed to lightning.  However, as of early February, the investigation was still ongoing, and the final determination of the cause had not been determined.There have been cases in the past, where lightning energy was transferred into underground coal mines, and caused seals from worked out areas to blow.",,"PDS"

The high tide in Phialdelphia reached 8.44 feet above mean lwoer low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water. The tidal flooding was caused by the east to northeast flow between a low pressure system that moved west to east across the central part of the United States and a high pressure system that skirted across southeastern Canada. The low pressure system moved from northeastern Missouri around sunrise on the 2nd into Indiana during the evening of the 2nd and Ohio around daybreak on the 3rd. A secondary low pressure system formed along its warm frontal boundary on the Delmarva Peninsula early in the morning on the 3rd and moved east fairly rapidly.

These strong winds were accompanied with heavy rain showers.  The most widespread wind damage occurred across eastern and southeastern Massachusetts, where numerous trees, limbs and wires were reported down.  Sustained wind reports generally ranged between 30 and 49 MPH, with gusts between 58 and 68 MPH.  However, some higher wind speeds were observed.  For example, Blue Hill Observatory measured a sustained wind speed of 61 MPH with a wind gust speed of 85 MPH during this storm.Trees were reported down in towns across the state, including in Worthington, Hudson, Groton, Southborough, Bedford, Newton, Danvers, Peobody, Topsfield, Foxboro, Taunton, Brockton, Marshfield, Middleboro, Swansea, and in North Scituate.  Trees fell down on houses in Springfield, Westford, Framingham, Haverhill, and in Carver.  These downed trees closed roads and caused numerous power outages across the state.  Siding was torn off of a building on Elm Street in Walpole.  In addition, a 50-ft section of tin roofing came off a hanger, with at least 3 doors blown off their mounts, and the office trailer blown onto its side, at the Mansfield airport.There was one known fatality from this storm.

As a result, drought conditions intensified across South Texas during February 2006.  During February, drought conditions moved into the exceptional category (per the U.S. Drought Monitor) across the Rio Grande Plains and Northern Coastal Bend.  Extreme drought conditions, per the monitor, developed across the remainder of the Coastal Bend. February 2006 was the 4th driest on record (out of 120 years) at the Corpus Christi International Airport, with only 0.05 inches of rainfall, which was only 2.7% of normal.  Victoria received only 0.61 inches of rainfall, which was only 30% of normal.  Radar estimates of February 2006 monthly rainfall indicate most areas of South Texas received less than 10% of normal rainfall for February. The exception was Victoria and Calhoun counties as well as portions of Goliad, Northern Refugio, and Eastern Live Oak counties, where generally 10-40% of normal rainfall was estimated.Corpus Christi International Airport experienced their 5th driest winter (Dec-Feb) on record, with only 0.67 inches of rainfall.  Victoria had their 4th driest winter on record, with only 2.60 inches of rainfall.  Beeville and Laredo both had their 2nd driest winter on record, with 0.99 inches and 0.31 inches respectively.The fire danger also continued across South Texas in February.  Sporadic, small wildfires occurred through the month across South Texas.  Reservoir levels at Choke Canyon and Lake Corpus Christi also continued to slowly fall through the month.","PDS"

Peak wind gusts nearly reached 70 mph during the early morning and averaged around 45 mph during the westerly flow in the late morning and afternoon. The morning high winds downed numerous trees and power lines and caused traveling delays during the morning rush due to closed roads. Garbage and recycling pails were strewn. Several roofs were torn away. More roofs and homes were damaged by downed trees. Vehicles were also damaged by downed trees. Throughout the state about 150,000 homes and businesses lost power. It took until the afternoon of the 19th to have power fully restored. Hardest hit were Camden, Gloucester and Middlesex Counties. No serious injuries were reported. Similar to the strong to high winds on the 14th and 15th the wet ground and in this case a different wind direction (southeast) during the early morning made it easier for trees to be uprooted. In Cumberland County, several roads were closed in Bridgeton, Greenwich, Millville and Vineland. Trees up to 4.5 feet in diameter were snapped in Millville. In Atlantic County, downed trees and wires forced traffic to be routed onto the White Horse Pike (U.S. Route 30) and the Atlantic City Expressway. A piece of a large sign at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino fell down and caused a road closure. No injuries at street level occurred. Gloucester County Emergency Services was rocked with 415 weather related calls. One downed tree fell into a home in Franklin Township.

The high tide at Reedy Island (New Castle County in Delaware) reached 7.29 feet above mean lower low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water. The high tide in Phialdelphia reached 8.44 feet above mean lwoer low water. Minor tidal flooding begins at 8.2 feet above mean lower low water. The tidal flooding was caused by the east to northeast flow between a low pressure system that moved west to east across the central part of the United States and a high pressure system that skirted across southeastern Canada. The low pressure system moved from northeastern Missouri around sunrise on the 2nd into Indiana during the evening of the 2nd and Ohio around daybreak on the 3rd. A secondary low pressure system formed along its warm frontal boundary on the Delmarva Peninsula early in the morning on the 3rd and moved east fairly rapidly. By 7 p.m. EST on the 3rd it was already about 400 miles east of Atlantic City.  While the low pressure system moved well offshore by the morning of the 4th, the high pressure system built south into northern New England. This maintained a weaker, (but still) up the bay flow and helped cause pockets of minor tidal flooding with the daytime high tide cycle.",,"PDS"

A deep trough of low pressure formed in the upper levels with a 140 kt jet streak passing over Iowa during the day on the 24th.  A strong tropospheric fold was evident as the jet streak passed with stratospheric air extending well below 850 mb.  Winds increased quite rapidly after sunrise with mid day winds sustained in the 40 to 45 MPH range over the CWA by mid day.  Winds became quite gusty as well with most locations recording gusts of at least 50 to 55 mph.  Several locations reported wind gusts in excess of 60 MPH.  The strongest wind gust recorded was a 69 MPH wind gust at the Ames Airport in Story County.  The strongest winds were in a band about 40 miles wide extending from Calhoun and Webster Counties on the northwest, southeast to Lucas, Marion, and Mahaska Counties on the southeast.  Winds in this band gusted to 60 to 65 MPH for a one to two hour period.  There as also a wind gust to 61 MPH in southwest Iowa in Union County, and a gust to 51 MPH in Cerro Gordo and Franklin Counties.  Two people were injured in Des Moines by flying glass.  High winds blew out a window broke out of the Polk County Human Resources Building.  There were numerous reports of local power outages as branches took down power lines.  Some accidents were caused by the high winds as drivers lost control of their vehicles.  Spotty reports of trucks being overturned were also received.

During the first week of the month, D2 (severe) drought conditions, per the U.S. Drought Monitor, spread in areal coverage to encompass all of the west Texas South Plains region. By the end of February, conditions had further deteriorated, with a D3 (extreme) drought progressing over the northern South Plains and the Texas Panhandle. This despite the region's first measurable rainfall since late October 2005, which occurred on the morning of February 3rd when Lubbock received 0.03 inches of rain. Tulia (Swisher County) received the only significant rainfall of the event, measuring 0.38 inches. The continued threat for wildfires over much of the Southern Plains of the U.S. continued to make national media headlines. Critical fire weather conditions, however, were dampened somewhat over west Texas during the month of February. The decrease in wildfire activity across the South Plains region was likely due to a relative lack of strong westerly winds and at least two cold fronts that brought periods of below normal temperatures and higher relative humidities. Abnormally warm conditions returned to the region by the month's end with record high temperatures again posted at Childress and Lubbock on the 27th and the 28th, including a monthly record warm temperature of 89 degrees at Lubbock on the 28th.Most crops across the region had been harvested by the time the drought commenced, and the dry weather actually helped farmers extract cotton from the fields during the late fall. The drought, however, is expected to have long-term adverse effects as fields are prepared and planting begins during the upcoming growing season. Thus agricultural losses resulting from the drought will likely be realized at future dates according to local extension agents.",,"PDS"

The strongest wind gust recorded was a 69 MPH wind gust at the Ames Airport in Story County.  The strongest winds were in a band about 40 miles wide extending from Calhoun and Webster Counties on the northwest, southeast to Lucas, Marion, and Mahaska Counties on the southeast.  Winds in this band gusted to 60 to 65 MPH for a one to two hour period.  There as also a wind gust to 61 MPH in southwest Iowa in Union County, and a gust to 51 MPH in Cerro Gordo and Franklin Counties.  Two people were injured in Des Moines by flying glass.  High winds blew out a window broke out of the Polk County Human Resources Building.  There were numerous reports of local power outages as branches took down power lines.  Some accidents were caused by the high winds as drivers lost control of their vehicles.  Spotty reports of trucks being overturned were also received.  In Polk County, the mile long bridge over Saylorville Reservoir was closed for several hours due to the high wind.",,"PDS"

During the first week of the month, D2 (severe) drought conditions, per the U.S. Drought Monitor, spread in areal coverage to encompass all of the west Texas South Plains region. By the end of February, conditions had further deteriorated, with a D3 (extreme) drought progressing over the northern South Plains and the Texas Panhandle. This despite the region's first measurable rainfall since late October 2005, which occurred on the morning of February 3rd when Lubbock received 0.03 inches of rain. Tulia (Swisher County) received the only significant rainfall of the event, measuring 0.38 inches. The continued threat for wildfires over much of the Southern Plains of the U.S. continued to make national media headlines. Critical fire weather conditions, however, were dampened somewhat over west Texas during the month of February. The decrease in wildfire activity across the South Plains region was likely due to a relative lack of strong westerly winds and at least two cold fronts that brought periods of below normal temperatures and higher relative humidities. Abnormally warm conditions returned to the region by the month's end with record high temperatures again posted at Childress and Lubbock on the 27th and the 28th, including a monthly record warm temperature of 89 degrees at Lubbock on the 28th.Most crops across the region had been harvested by the time the drought commenced, and the dry weather actually helped farmers extract cotton from the fields during the late fall. The drought, however, is expected to have long-term adverse effects as fields are prepared and planting begins during the upcoming growing season. Thus agricultural losses resulting from the drought will likely be realized at future dates according to local extension agents.",,"PDS"

The low levels of the atmosphere were quite unstable as the cold front moved across the region, which allowed strong wind aloft to mix to the surface at the time of the frontal passage.","On January 21, trees and wires were blown down in Winsted.","PDS"

By the end of February, conditions had further deteriorated, with a D3 (extreme) drought progressing over the northern South Plains and the Texas Panhandle.

The continued threat for wildfires over much of the Southern Plains of the U.S. continued to make national media headlines. Critical fire weather conditions, however, were dampened somewhat over west Texas during the month of February. The decrease in wildfire activity across the South Plains region was likely due to a relative lack of strong westerly winds and at least two cold fronts that brought periods of below normal temperatures and higher relative humidities. Abnormally warm conditions returned to the region by the month's end with record high temperatures again posted at Childress and Lubbock on the 27th and the 28th, including a monthly record warm temperature of 89 degrees at Lubbock on the 28th.Most crops across the region had been harvested by the time the drought commenced, and the dry weather actually helped farmers extract cotton from the fields during the late fall.

During the first week of the month, D2 (severe) drought conditions, per the U.S. Drought Monitor, spread in areal coverage to encompass all of the west Texas South Plains region. By the end of February, conditions had further deteriorated, with a D3 (extreme) drought progressing over the northern South Plains and the Texas Panhandle. This despite the region's first measurable rainfall since late October 2005, which occurred on the morning of February 3rd when Lubbock received 0.03 inches of rain. Tulia (Swisher County) received the only significant rainfall of the event, measuring 0.38 inches. The continued threat for wildfires over much of the Southern Plains of the U.S. continued to make national media headlines. Critical fire weather conditions, however, were dampened somewhat over west Texas during the month of February. The decrease in wildfire activity across the South Plains region was likely due to a relative lack of strong westerly winds and at least two cold fronts that brought periods of below normal temperatures and higher relative humidities. Abnormally warm conditions returned to the region by the month's end with record high temperatures again posted at Childress and Lubbock on the 27th and the 28th, including a monthly record warm temperature of 89 degrees at Lubbock on the 28th.Most crops across the region had been harvested by the time the drought commenced, and the dry weather actually helped farmers extract cotton from the fields during the late fall. The drought, however, is expected to have long-term adverse effects as fields are prepared and planting begins during the upcoming growing season. Thus agricultural losses resulting from the drought will likely be realized at future dates according to local extension agents.",,"PDS"

Peak wind gusts nearly reached 70 mph during the early morning and averaged around 45 mph during the westerly flow in the late morning and afternoon. The morning high winds downed numerous trees and power lines and caused traveling delays during the morning rush due to closed roads. Garbage and recycling pails were strewn. Several roofs were torn away. More roofs and homes were damaged by downed trees. Vehicles were also damaged by downed trees. Throughout the state about 150,000 homes and businesses lost power. It took until the afternoon of the 19th to have power fully restored. Hardest hit were Camden, Gloucester and Middlesex Counties. No serious injuries were reported. Similar to the strong to high winds on the 14th and 15th the wet ground and in this case a different wind direction (southeast) during the early morning made it easier for trees to be uprooted. In Cumberland County, several roads were closed in Bridgeton, Greenwich, Millville and Vineland. Trees up to 4.5 feet in diameter were snapped in Millville. In Atlantic County, downed trees and wires forced traffic to be routed onto the White Horse Pike (U.S. Route 30) and the Atlantic City Expressway. A piece of a large sign at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino fell down and caused a road closure. No injuries at street level occurred. Gloucester County Emergency Services was rocked with 415 weather related calls. One downed tree fell into a home in Franklin Township. Trees fell onto roofs in Monroe Township and Pitman Borough. a downed tree destroyed a porch in the city of Woodbury. The high winds also destroyed an advertising sign in the city. Power outages forced school cancellations in East Greenwich Township, Franklin Township, Logan Township, Newfield Borough and South Harrison Township. In Camden County, downed trees crashed through the roofs of homes in Audubon and Berlin Boroughs. About 5 other homes in Berlin had large pine trees on their roofs. Two roofs in Gloucester City were damaged by downed trees. A large billboard just off of Admiral Wilson Boulevard in Camden was knocked down. Shingles were ripped from homes in Pennsauken Township. A downed tree severely backed up traffic on Camden County Route 561 in Cherry Hill Township. Large power outages affected Cherry Hill and Pennsauken Townships. The power outages caused a delay opening for Camden County College.   In Burlington County, a county salt silo in Delran Township lost its roof and one wall collapsed. In Moorestown Township, a roof of one home was damaged by a downed tree. Downed trees blocked Camden Avenue.  In Willingboro Township, sheds were tossed over fences. A downed pole on new Jersey State Route 73 and Ramblewood Parkway in Mount Laurel Township caused large traffic disruptions. In Mercer County, the tin roof of a home was peeled away by the high winds. In Morris County, downed wires caused the complete closure of Eastbound New Jersey State Route 10 in Parsippany Township and diverted traffic onto New Jersey State Route 53. One third of Boonton Township lost power. All Mendham Township schools were closed.In Middlesex County, a large portion (50 feet by 60 feet) of the Highland Park Borough Department of Public Works building was peeled away. Shingles and insulation was also blown away. The roof landed onto and damaged two unoccupied vehicles. In Sayreville Borough, one tree damaged the roof of a home. Vehicles were damaged by downed trees in New Brunswick. Road closures occurred in Highland Park Borough, Spottswood Borough, Monroe Township, Sayreville Borough and Woodbridge Township. In Woodbridge Township, the ramp from U.S. Route 1 to New Jersey State Route 35 was closed. Large outages occurred in Edison and Old Bridge Townships. In Monmouth County, in Raritan Bay a passenger ferry en route to Manhattan from Belford (Middletown Township) was struck by waves that crashed over its bough. All passengers put on life jackets. The ferry arrived safely, but subsequent service was postponed for several hours. In Middletown Township, a school bus struck a downed tree, but no injuries occurred. Vehicles were damaged by downed trees in Colts Neck Township and Englishtown Borough. Freehold Township emergency services responded to 75 weather related calls.

The strong and high winds were caused by an increasing southeasterly low level jet preceding a cold front during the early morning of the 18th. This feature peaked at about 100 mph about 2,000 feet above the ground. The cold front moved through New Jersey between 9 a.m. EST and 11 a.m. EST on the 18th and strong west winds occurred behind the front from late in the morning through most of the afternoon before they diminished at night.",,"PDS"

The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.

During the night of 15 February mainly light mixed precipitation fell over eastern Iowa, northwest and west central Illinois, and far northeast Missouri due to a shallow layer of cold air near the surface.  Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.  Areas south of Interstate 80 generally saw an inch or less of snowfall.",,"PDS"

This resulted in up to 10 inches of snow in an area extending from the intersection of M59 and US23 northeastward through the thumb region of Michigan. Unseasonably warm air ahead of this system led to a period of moderate rain Saturday morning and into the early afternoon. By mid afternoon the rain had changed over to a very wet snow and for the most part continued to melt as it fell while temperatures remained above freezing. At sunset, temperatures fell to the freezing mark and snow began accumulating around 1800 EST on the 4th and reached 6 inches by midnight. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches an hour occurred across portions of the thumb overnight. The large wet snowflakes easily stuck to rain soaked trees. The weighted trees were further stressed by northwest winds gusting to 35 mph and caused many branches to break. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power with 15 electrical wires down in Lapeer County alone. Accumulating snow ended at 1100 EST on the 5th. Effects from this storm continued to be felt on Monday and Tuesday as most schools across the thumb region closed as a result of the blowing and drifting snow on Sunday.

Heavy snow on the west side of the system arrived late in the day on the 4th, with the heaviest snow in Northeast Lower Michigan.  There was a gradual transition to lake effect snow late on the 5th and into the 6th as the system departed and cold air flooded the region.  By then, the heavier snow shifted into the snowbelts of Eastern Upper and Northwest Lower Michigan.  Strong and gusty winds, starting from the east and eventually turning to the northwest, produced blowing and drifting snow throughout the storm.  Snowfall totals were in excess of 10 inches across a broad portion of North Central and Northeast Lower Michigan.  Maximum accumulations, 16 to 18 inches, occurred near Alpena and Rogers City.  The snow and winds contributed to a fatal auto accident near Spratt in Alpena County, when a pickup truck skidded off M-65 into a ditch and overturned, killing the driver.  Heavy snowfall was somewhat less widespread in the lake effect snowbelts to the west of I-75, but there were still storm totals near in foot in spots near Whitefish Bay, as well as north of M-72.",,"PDS"

The amount of accumulation varied with only a narrow corridor from Northeast Louisiana to portions of Northeast Mississippi receiving 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch of ice accumulation. A large portion of the region did see freezing rain, but for the most part, accumulations of ice stayed below 1/4 of an inch. Across Northeast Louisiana, the core of heaviest freezing rain occurred from Southwest Richland parish across Northern Franklin parish into the west half of Madison parish. Here 1/4 to 0.4 inches of ice occurred and caused bridges and overpasses to freeze over and ice to weigh down trees and power lines. Across Central and Northeast Mississippi, the core of freezing rain was a bit larger and extended from eastern Yazoo to Northeast Winston county. Here 1/4 to 0.6 inches of ice accumulation occurred. Many bridges and overpasses were iced over along with ice on trees and power lines.For the most part, damage remained minimal as the corridor that was affected was rather narrow. Additionally, this ice event occurred during the morning and mid-day hours of a federal holiday, Presidents' Day. Due to the holiday, schools were off and many businesses were closed resulting in much less road traffic than usual.",,"PDS"

Being the middle of winter, the affects of the drought were essentially hydrologic in nature. A summary of the conditions for February 2006 is given by the service hydrologist.River ConditionsStream flows began the month with most locations reporting normal (25th to 75th percentile) to above normal (76th to 90th percentile) conditions.  Stream flows gradually decreased during the month, showing little change in response to the storm system around the 16th of the month.  At the end of the month most locations reported stream flows that were below normal (10th to 24th percentile) or much below normal (less than 10th percentile).  A few locations reported near normal conditions and one location reported a record low for the day.Source: U.S. Geological Survey.  Their WaterWatch Web site has an animation of daily flow percentiles for the United States (http://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/waterwatch_animation?200602).DroughtFor the entire HSA, the three-month precipitation total was 3.86 inches or 0.71 inches below normal and 85% of normal.  The six-month precipitation total is 9.91 inches or 3.20 inches below normal and 76% of normal.  The 12-month precipitation total is 23.35 inches or 12.88 inches below normal and 64% of normal.According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps (http://drought.unl.edu/dm/), the extreme drought conditions (D3) which affected eastern portions of the HSA in the beginning of the month no longer exist.  Severe drought conditions (D2) now cover much of the HSA with moderate drought conditions (D1) across northwestern portions of the HSA.",,"PDS"

Forty homes were destroyed in Montague County as a 17-mile long fire burned between Ringgold and Nocona.  Another grass fire in Johnson County burned 13 buildings and charred 1,800 acres.  In Eastland County, a fire encompassing more than 35,000 acres forced the evacuations of several communities and destroyed the city of Kokomo.  Thirty-six buildings were lost in the fire.  Several firefighters and civilians suffered burns, smoke inhalation, and heat exhaustion due to the fires.Hydrological and agricultural impacts worsened over the past month due to the lack of rainfall.  Most water reservoirs across north Texas were 60% to 85% of normal capacity.  Several lakes across the region were 10 to 15 feet below normal pool elevation.  The North Texas Municipal Water District implemented watering restrictions earlier than normal this year due to the lowering lake levels.  Watering restrictions were also in effect on a voluntary basis in some cities. The Texas Cooperative Extension estimated agricultural losses for north Texas to be close to $1 billion in January.  Only half of the state's hay crop was fit for harvesting, and hay prices were three to four times their normal price.  Many other crops failed to grow at all.  Agricultural groups appealed for federal grants to aid the cattle industry.  One emergency measure considered by the federal government included providing cash to ranchers to offset high feed costs and losses due to the drought and wildfires. A drought summit was held in San Antonio to discuss the crisis. The drought was also affecting wildlife in north Texas.  The Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife reported an overall decline in habitat conditions, and noted that the lack of green plants would affect the survival rate of certain animals.",,"PDS"

Stream flows gradually decreased during the month, showing little change in response to the storm system around the 16th of the month.  At the end of the month most locations reported stream flows that were below normal (10th to 24th percentile) or much below normal (less than 10th percentile).  A few locations reported near normal conditions and one location reported a record low for the day.Source: U.S. Geological Survey.  Their WaterWatch Web site has an animation of daily flow percentiles for the United States (http://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/waterwatch_animation?200602).DroughtFor the entire HSA, the three-month precipitation total was 3.86 inches or 0.71 inches below normal and 85% of normal.  The six-month precipitation total is 9.91 inches or 3.20 inches below normal and 76% of normal.  The 12-month precipitation total is 23.35 inches or 12.88 inches below normal and 64% of normal.According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps (http://drought.unl.edu/dm/), the extreme drought conditions (D3) which affected eastern portions of the HSA in the beginning of the month no longer exist.

During the night of 15 February mainly light mixed precipitation fell over eastern Iowa, northwest and west central Illinois, and far northeast Missouri due to a shallow layer of cold air near the surface.  Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.  Areas south of Interstate 80 generally saw an inch or less of snowfall.",,"PDS"

The area of heaviest rain was so concentrated that downtown St. Petersburg, less than 10 miles away, recorded less than an inch of rain during the same period.  The torrential rains caused flash flooding in the areas where more than 8 inches fell. The flash flooding prompted the mayor of St. Petersburg to term the event a ""hundred year flood"".

Snowfall totals were in excess of 10 inches across a broad portion of North Central and Northeast Lower Michigan.  Maximum accumulations, 16 to 18 inches, occurred near Alpena and Rogers City.  The snow and winds contributed to a fatal auto accident near Spratt in Alpena County, when a pickup truck skidded off M-65 into a ditch and overturned, killing the driver.

After a lull, very heavy precipitation arrived in the afternoon.  This fell as rain and freezing rain south of a line from Houghton Lake to Harrisville, and snow to the north.  Thunder was common in this portion of the event, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snow accumulations (locally higher), and a quarter to a half inch of ice accumulation in places like Gladwin and Tawas City.

Genevieve County near Highway NN and just west of the community of Giboney. The tornado moved northeast, crossing Interstate 55 only about one-half mile from the Ste. Genevieve County line. Two fatalities and F3 damage occurred in the vicinity of where the tornado crossed U.S. Route 61. The two fatalities occurred on U.S. 61, where a vehicle was picked up and thrown into a propane tank. The truck in which they were riding was likely picked up, flipped over, and slammed into the ground several times. The coroner stated that the victims died instantly. One of the victims was ejected from the truck, which then struck the top of a large propane tank. Because of the ensuing propane leak, the victim still in the truck could not be removed until the following day, when the propane was off-loaded from the tank. Both of the victims in the vehicle were residents of a mobile home who were trying to flee the tornado. The home from which they fled sustained only minor damage. At least four other people were significantly injured as they were picked up by tornadic winds and hurled 100 yards. Their injuries were compounded by wind-blown debris. Eight victims were admitted to a local hospital to remove debris which penetrated their bodies, and two others were sent to regional hospitals for serious injuries. Three mobile homes were flattened, a brick house had its roof and several walls blown off, and numerous vehicles were tossed around. A total of about a dozen residences were destroyed or severely damaged in Perry County. Perry County was designated a federal disaster area, enabling individual residents to apply for relief. The dashboard camera in a sheriff deputy's patrol car captured the tornado on film as it crossed U.S. 61 at F3 intensity. Peak winds were estimated near 170 MPH.  The tornado crossed into Randolph County, Illinois at Old River, near some railroad tracks about 1.5 miles southeast of St. Marys.","PDS"

After a lull, very heavy precipitation arrived in the afternoon.  This fell as rain and freezing rain south of a line from Houghton Lake to Harrisville, and snow to the north.  Thunder was common in this portion of the event, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snow accumulations (locally higher), and a quarter to a half inch of ice accumulation in places like Gladwin and Tawas City.  Another lull arrived in the evening, before wraparound snow and lake effect snow kicked in during the night and continued into the next day.  Parts of Chippewa County saw the snow continue into the 18th.  Storm total accumulations were from 6 to 15 inches, generally south of M-28, and north of Houghton Lake and Harrisville.  The highest accumulations, greater than a foot, were in a narrow band from Frankfort to Gaylord to Rogers City.  Strong winds, especially during the afternoon of the 16th through the 17th, produced considerable blowing snow and drifts as high as 4 feet.  Many areas schools let out early on the 16th (a Thursday), in anticipation of the heavier round of snow expected that afternoon.  That would prove wise, as there were a number of vehicle accidents in the near-zero visibility that the thundersnow produced.  A number of schools remained closed into the 17th.  There were a number of power outages, especially where ice accumulations were highest, as the strong winds (gusts to 35 mph) brought down ice-covered tree limbs.  Some places went without power for several days.",,"PDS"

The initial band of snow lifted northward into the region in the pre-dawn hours, brining 2 to 6 inches of snow to most of Northern Lower Michigan (generally south of M-68).  After a lull, very heavy precipitation arrived in the afternoon.  This fell as rain and freezing rain south of a line from Houghton Lake to Harrisville, and snow to the north.  Thunder was common in this portion of the event, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snow accumulations (locally higher), and a quarter to a half inch of ice accumulation in places like Gladwin and Tawas City.  Another lull arrived in the evening, before wraparound snow and lake effect snow kicked in during the night and continued into the next day.  Parts of Chippewa County saw the snow continue into the 18th.  Storm total accumulations were from 6 to 15 inches, generally south of M-28, and north of Houghton Lake and Harrisville.  The highest accumulations, greater than a foot, were in a narrow band from Frankfort to Gaylord to Rogers City.  Strong winds, especially during the afternoon of the 16th through the 17th, produced considerable blowing snow and drifts as high as 4 feet.  Many areas schools let out early on the 16th (a Thursday), in anticipation of the heavier round of snow expected that afternoon.  That would prove wise, as there were a number of vehicle accidents in the near-zero visibility that the thundersnow produced.  A number of schools remained closed into the 17th.  There were a number of power outages, especially where ice accumulations were highest, as the strong winds (gusts to 35 mph) brought down ice-covered tree limbs.

Unseasonably warm air ahead of this system led to a period of moderate rain Saturday morning and into the early afternoon. By mid afternoon the rain had changed over to a very wet snow and for the most part continued to melt as it fell while temperatures remained above freezing. At sunset, temperatures fell to the freezing mark and snow began accumulating around 1800 EST on the 4th and reached 6 inches by midnight. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches an hour occurred across portions of the thumb overnight. The large wet snowflakes easily stuck to rain soaked trees. The weighted trees were further stressed by northwest winds gusting to 35 mph and caused many branches to break. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power with 15 electrical wires down in Lapeer County alone. Accumulating snow ended at 1100 EST on the 5th.

The tornado was rated an F2 and traveled a path of seven miles, of which approximately four miles occurred within Fulton county.  The maximum path width was 1/4 mile wide.  Roof damage was observed to a number of homes along the path of the tornado.  At least six homes east of Palmetto had sustained major damage with large trees down on the structures.  Additionally, a number of trees were down along the path along with several power lines.  Specifically, the tornado began around 8225 Tatum Road.  Numerous trees were down in this area and several homes had sustained roof damage.  The chimney was destroyed on one home.  The tornado then continued across the intersection of Johnson and Tatum Road to Gullatt Road.  Several homes in this area had sustained roof damage and in fact, one home had completely lost its roof.  Numerous trees were either uprooted or snapped off along the path and several power lines were down as well.  From this point, the tornado traveled toward the intersection of Bohannon and Kirkley Roads.

Though somewhat early in  the season for such a storm, the storm was a classic storm.  As it quite typical of April or  May, the storm was a classic ""bowling ball"" type system with a closed upper low lifting northeast out of the southwest U.S.  Surface low pressure moved from Kansas into Southwest Iowa during the event.  A dryline pushed northeast with the low into the state.  Strong moisture transport took place ahead of the storm with dew points reaching the mid 50s to low 60s over Iowa as afternoon temperatures were in the 60 to 70 degree range.  Strong south winds in the low levels were in place with speeds in the 35 to 45 kt range.  The atmosphere destabilized during the afternoon with lifted indices reaching -7 by the early afternoon.  CAPE values were not all that great, at about 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level during the storms was relatively low, at about 10,700 feet.  Thunderstorms developed in western Iowa and lifted northeast at 50 to 55 MPH during the afternoon.  These formed in the warm sector.  At the same time, the dryline pushed into western Iowa during the late afternoon.  The storms from the dryline produced hail and strong winds, along with 2 small tornadoes.  The line of storms took on a bow echo appearance as they raced across the state.  The storms that formed ahead of the dryline were not as significant and produced only marginal severe weather.  As the dryline storms moved in, reports of hail and high wind were numerous.  Two small tornadoes touched down briefly, causing little damage.  One was west of the Creston Airport in Union County, the second was near De Soto in Dallas County.  Minor damage occurred with the tornado west of Creston as it damaged breeze way and carport there.  High winds were quite wide spread with wind speeds reaching or exceeding 80 MPH at times.  In Latimer winds of 80 MPH took the roof off of a building for example.  In Franklin County,  high winds lifted bleachers and threw them 300 feet, across a road.  Damage was reported to an apartment building roof in Crawford County and a dugout destroyed as well.  Several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being overturned were received.  One was overturned in Crawford County on the Shelby County line, 6 were overturned in Adair County by 71 MPH winds with one person receiving minor injuries.  Six trucks were blown off the highway in Guthrie County and another in Story County.  Two people were injured in Boone County when high winds blew a tree onto a mobile home.  The mobile home was totally destroyed.  Three mobile homes were flipped in Story County by the high winds.  Reports of damage to outbuildings were too numerous to mention here.  Hail reports were quite numerous.  Much of the hail was around an inch in diameter. One of the storms produced large hail in the Des Moines Metro area.  Two inch diameter hail fell in Des Moines, with golf ball size hail in Norwalk and one and one half inch diameter hail falling at the Des Moines Airport.",,"PDS"

During the night of 15 February mainly light mixed precipitation fell over eastern Iowa, northwest and west central Illinois, and far northeast Missouri due to a shallow layer of cold air near the surface.  Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.  Areas south of Interstate 80 generally saw an inch or less of snowfall.",,"PDS"

Stream flows gradually decreased during the month, showing little change in response to the storm system around the 16th of the month.  At the end of the month most locations reported stream flows that were below normal (10th to 24th percentile) or much below normal (less than 10th percentile).  A few locations reported near normal conditions and one location reported a record low for the day.Source: U.S. Geological Survey.  Their WaterWatch Web site has an animation of daily flow percentiles for the United States (http://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/waterwatch_animation?200602).DroughtFor the entire HSA, the three-month precipitation total was 3.86 inches or 0.71 inches below normal and 85% of normal.

The 12-month precipitation total is 23.35 inches or 12.88 inches below normal and 64% of normal.According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps (http://drought.unl.edu/dm/), the extreme drought conditions (D3) which affected eastern portions of the HSA in the beginning of the month no longer exist.

The time frame was late on a Friday afternoon and into the early evening.The initial severe weather was large hail.  However, the storms following the initial cells, consolidated and organized into a squall line.  On its leading edge, severe wind gust moved out of Pike County Kentucky and through Mingo County around 1630E.  Trees fell and damaged a few homes.  Several commercial and residential buildings in Williamson sustained damage from the wind alone.  A large portion of the damage was to awnings, porches, siding, and roofs.  Signs and poles were also damaged.  Two women received injuries to their legs when the wooden pavilion near the river collapsed.  Debris littered the downtown streets.  The strong wind gust blew through eastern Logan County.  Windows were blown out of 3 or 4 businesses in Man.  In the Elk Creek region of Logan County, a woman was trapped on her bed in a mobile home. A tree had fallen into the house and laid across the bed.  The railings of the hospital type bed helped prevent a more serious injury.  In McDowell County, 3 mobile homes were damaged.  In Wyoming County, a roof was damaged near Baileysville.Brief and sudden wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely on the leading edge of the squall line, with the speed dependent on exposure and channeling of the wind through the valleys and hollows.  In the case of downtown Williamson, channeling of the wind between buildings also came into play.  No tornadoes were confirmed or indicated by weather radar.As this complex moved through Fayette and Raleigh Counties, large hail again occurred.  Hail as big as golf balls fell around Beckley and Grandview.  One major insurance company reported about 450 claims, mostly vehicular hail damage.",,"PDS"

Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.

Thunder was common in this portion of the event, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snow accumulations (locally higher), and a quarter to a half inch of ice accumulation in places like Gladwin and Tawas City.  Another lull arrived in the evening, before wraparound snow and lake effect snow kicked in during the night and continued into the next day.  Parts of Chippewa County saw the snow continue into the 18th.  Storm total accumulations were from 6 to 15 inches, generally south of M-28, and north of Houghton Lake and Harrisville.

The initial band of snow lifted northward into the region in the pre-dawn hours, brining 2 to 6 inches of snow to most of Northern Lower Michigan (generally south of M-68).  After a lull, very heavy precipitation arrived in the afternoon.  This fell as rain and freezing rain south of a line from Houghton Lake to Harrisville, and snow to the north.  Thunder was common in this portion of the event, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snow accumulations (locally higher), and a quarter to a half inch of ice accumulation in places like Gladwin and Tawas City.  Another lull arrived in the evening, before wraparound snow and lake effect snow kicked in during the night and continued into the next day.  Parts of Chippewa County saw the snow continue into the 18th.  Storm total accumulations were from 6 to 15 inches, generally south of M-28, and north of Houghton Lake and Harrisville.  The highest accumulations, greater than a foot, were in a narrow band from Frankfort to Gaylord to Rogers City.  Strong winds, especially during the afternoon of the 16th through the 17th, produced considerable blowing snow and drifts as high as 4 feet.  Many areas schools let out early on the 16th (a Thursday), in anticipation of the heavier round of snow expected that afternoon.  That would prove wise, as there were a number of vehicle accidents in the near-zero visibility that the thundersnow produced.  A number of schools remained closed into the 17th.  There were a number of power outages, especially where ice accumulations were highest, as the strong winds (gusts to 35 mph) brought down ice-covered tree limbs.  Some places went without power for several days.",,"PDS"

The time frame was late on a Friday afternoon and into the early evening.The initial severe weather was large hail.  However, the storms following the initial cells, consolidated and organized into a squall line.  On its leading edge, severe wind gust moved out of Pike County Kentucky and through Mingo County around 1630E.  Trees fell and damaged a few homes.  Several commercial and residential buildings in Williamson sustained damage from the wind alone.  A large portion of the damage was to awnings, porches, siding, and roofs.  Signs and poles were also damaged.  Two women received injuries to their legs when the wooden pavilion near the river collapsed.  Debris littered the downtown streets.  The strong wind gust blew through eastern Logan County.  Windows were blown out of 3 or 4 businesses in Man.  In the Elk Creek region of Logan County, a woman was trapped on her bed in a mobile home. A tree had fallen into the house and laid across the bed.  The railings of the hospital type bed helped prevent a more serious injury.  In McDowell County, 3 mobile homes were damaged.  In Wyoming County, a roof was damaged near Baileysville.Brief and sudden wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely on the leading edge of the squall line, with the speed dependent on exposure and channeling of the wind through the valleys and hollows.  In the case of downtown Williamson, channeling of the wind between buildings also came into play.  No tornadoes were confirmed or indicated by weather radar.As this complex moved through Fayette and Raleigh Counties, large hail again occurred.  Hail as big as golf balls fell around Beckley and Grandview.  One major insurance company reported about 450 claims, mostly vehicular hail damage.",,"PDS"

Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.  Areas south of Interstate 80 generally saw an inch or less of snowfall.",,"PDS"

Heavy snow on the west side of the system arrived late in the day on the 4th, with the heaviest snow in Northeast Lower Michigan.  There was a gradual transition to lake effect snow late on the 5th and into the 6th as the system departed and cold air flooded the region.  By then, the heavier snow shifted into the snowbelts of Eastern Upper and Northwest Lower Michigan.  Strong and gusty winds, starting from the east and eventually turning to the northwest, produced blowing and drifting snow throughout the storm.  Snowfall totals were in excess of 10 inches across a broad portion of North Central and Northeast Lower Michigan.  Maximum accumulations, 16 to 18 inches, occurred near Alpena and Rogers City.  The snow and winds contributed to a fatal auto accident near Spratt in Alpena County, when a pickup truck skidded off M-65 into a ditch and overturned, killing the driver.

During the night of 15 February mainly light mixed precipitation fell over eastern Iowa, northwest and west central Illinois, and far northeast Missouri due to a shallow layer of cold air near the surface.  Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.  Areas south of Interstate 80 generally saw an inch or less of snowfall.",,"PDS"

Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.

Stream flows gradually decreased during the month, showing little change in response to the storm system around the 16th of the month.  At the end of the month most locations reported stream flows that were below normal (10th to 24th percentile) or much below normal (less than 10th percentile).  A few locations reported near normal conditions and one location reported a record low for the day.Source: U.S. Geological Survey.  Their WaterWatch Web site has an animation of daily flow percentiles for the United States (http://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/waterwatch_animation?200602).DroughtFor the entire HSA, the three-month precipitation total was 3.86 inches or 0.71 inches below normal and 85% of normal.

The time frame was late on a Friday afternoon and into the early evening.The initial severe weather was large hail.  However, the storms following the initial cells, consolidated and organized into a squall line.  On its leading edge, severe wind gust moved out of Pike County Kentucky and through Mingo County around 1630E.  Trees fell and damaged a few homes.  Several commercial and residential buildings in Williamson sustained damage from the wind alone.  A large portion of the damage was to awnings, porches, siding, and roofs.  Signs and poles were also damaged.  Two women received injuries to their legs when the wooden pavilion near the river collapsed.  Debris littered the downtown streets.  The strong wind gust blew through eastern Logan County.  Windows were blown out of 3 or 4 businesses in Man.  In the Elk Creek region of Logan County, a woman was trapped on her bed in a mobile home. A tree had fallen into the house and laid across the bed.  The railings of the hospital type bed helped prevent a more serious injury.  In McDowell County, 3 mobile homes were damaged.  In Wyoming County, a roof was damaged near Baileysville.Brief and sudden wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely on the leading edge of the squall line, with the speed dependent on exposure and channeling of the wind through the valleys and hollows.  In the case of downtown Williamson, channeling of the wind between buildings also came into play.  No tornadoes were confirmed or indicated by weather radar.As this complex moved through Fayette and Raleigh Counties, large hail again occurred.  Hail as big as golf balls fell around Beckley and Grandview.  One major insurance company reported about 450 claims, mostly vehicular hail damage.",,"PDS"

Snowfall totals were in excess of 10 inches across a broad portion of North Central and Northeast Lower Michigan.  Maximum accumulations, 16 to 18 inches, occurred near Alpena and Rogers City.  The snow and winds contributed to a fatal auto accident near Spratt in Alpena County, when a pickup truck skidded off M-65 into a ditch and overturned, killing the driver.

A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.

Unseasonably warm air ahead of this system led to a period of moderate rain Saturday morning and into the early afternoon. By mid afternoon the rain had changed over to a very wet snow and for the most part continued to melt as it fell while temperatures remained above freezing. At sunset, temperatures fell to the freezing mark and snow began accumulating around 1800 EST on the 4th and reached 6 inches by midnight. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches an hour occurred across portions of the thumb overnight. The large wet snowflakes easily stuck to rain soaked trees. The weighted trees were further stressed by northwest winds gusting to 35 mph and caused many branches to break.

Snowfall totals were in excess of 10 inches across a broad portion of North Central and Northeast Lower Michigan.  Maximum accumulations, 16 to 18 inches, occurred near Alpena and Rogers City.  The snow and winds contributed to a fatal auto accident near Spratt in Alpena County, when a pickup truck skidded off M-65 into a ditch and overturned, killing the driver.

The time frame was late on a Friday afternoon and into the early evening.The initial severe weather was large hail.  However, the storms following the initial cells, consolidated and organized into a squall line.  On its leading edge, severe wind gust moved out of Pike County Kentucky and through Mingo County around 1630E.  Trees fell and damaged a few homes.  Several commercial and residential buildings in Williamson sustained damage from the wind alone.  A large portion of the damage was to awnings, porches, siding, and roofs.  Signs and poles were also damaged.  Two women received injuries to their legs when the wooden pavilion near the river collapsed.  Debris littered the downtown streets.  The strong wind gust blew through eastern Logan County.  Windows were blown out of 3 or 4 businesses in Man.  In the Elk Creek region of Logan County, a woman was trapped on her bed in a mobile home. A tree had fallen into the house and laid across the bed.  The railings of the hospital type bed helped prevent a more serious injury.  In McDowell County, 3 mobile homes were damaged.  In Wyoming County, a roof was damaged near Baileysville.Brief and sudden wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely on the leading edge of the squall line, with the speed dependent on exposure and channeling of the wind through the valleys and hollows.  In the case of downtown Williamson, channeling of the wind between buildings also came into play.  No tornadoes were confirmed or indicated by weather radar.As this complex moved through Fayette and Raleigh Counties, large hail again occurred.  Hail as big as golf balls fell around Beckley and Grandview.  One major insurance company reported about 450 claims, mostly vehicular hail damage.",,"PDS"

Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.

Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.

After a lull, very heavy precipitation arrived in the afternoon.  This fell as rain and freezing rain south of a line from Houghton Lake to Harrisville, and snow to the north.  Thunder was common in this portion of the event, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snow accumulations (locally higher), and a quarter to a half inch of ice accumulation in places like Gladwin and Tawas City.  Another lull arrived in the evening, before wraparound snow and lake effect snow kicked in during the night and continued into the next day.  Parts of Chippewa County saw the snow continue into the 18th.  Storm total accumulations were from 6 to 15 inches, generally south of M-28, and north of Houghton Lake and Harrisville.  The highest accumulations, greater than a foot, were in a narrow band from Frankfort to Gaylord to Rogers City.  Strong winds, especially during the afternoon of the 16th through the 17th, produced considerable blowing snow and drifts as high as 4 feet.  Many areas schools let out early on the 16th (a Thursday), in anticipation of the heavier round of snow expected that afternoon.  That would prove wise, as there were a number of vehicle accidents in the near-zero visibility that the thundersnow produced.  A number of schools remained closed into the 17th.

During the night of 15 February mainly light mixed precipitation fell over eastern Iowa, northwest and west central Illinois, and far northeast Missouri due to a shallow layer of cold air near the surface.  Mainly snow was seen west of Dubuque along highway 20 and rain along the Illinois River.  A complete change over to all snow occurred during the afternoon of 16 February as the depth of the cold layer increased.Between 0530 and 1100 CST on 16 February two lines of elevated thunderstorms moved through the area.  These storms were prolific hail producers with numerous reports of 0.25 to 0.50 inch hail.  In some locations the hail covered the ground and reached a depth of up to one half inch.  The storms were also responsible for localized glaze accumulations of 0.25 to 0.40 inch across Henry and Bureau counties in Illinois and Des Moines county in Iowa.  Due to ambient temperatures at or below freezing, the hail froze into a thick layer of ice and caused power outages in southeast Iowa.Snow accumulations varied greatly across the area from the storm.  The heaviest accumulations were along the highway 20 corridor west of Dubuque where 4-6 inches of snow fell.  South and east of Dubuque, snowfall amounts ranged from a trace to 4 inches.  Areas south of Interstate 80 generally saw an inch or less of snowfall.",,"PDS"

This resulted in up to 10 inches of snow in an area extending from the intersection of M59 and US23 northeastward through the thumb region of Michigan. Unseasonably warm air ahead of this system led to a period of moderate rain Saturday morning and into the early afternoon. By mid afternoon the rain had changed over to a very wet snow and for the most part continued to melt as it fell while temperatures remained above freezing. At sunset, temperatures fell to the freezing mark and snow began accumulating around 1800 EST on the 4th and reached 6 inches by midnight. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches an hour occurred across portions of the thumb overnight. The large wet snowflakes easily stuck to rain soaked trees. The weighted trees were further stressed by northwest winds gusting to 35 mph and caused many branches to break. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power with 15 electrical wires down in Lapeer County alone. Accumulating snow ended at 1100 EST on the 5th. Effects from this storm continued to be felt on Monday and Tuesday as most schools across the thumb region closed as a result of the blowing and drifting snow on Sunday. Here are some of the higher snowfall reports received from each county:Bad Axe (Huron) 8 inchesFairgrove (Tuscola) 10 inchesBrown City (Sanilac) 8 inchesBurton (Genesee) 7.8 inchesMetamora (Lapeer) 9.5 inchesCapac (St. Clair) 6.5 inchesTyrone (Livingston) 9.0 inchesClarkston (Oakland) 9.3 inchesWashington (Macomb) 6.5 inches",,"PDS"
