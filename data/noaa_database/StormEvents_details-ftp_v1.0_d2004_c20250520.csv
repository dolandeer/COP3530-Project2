For the first time in recorded history, some areas experienced their first white Christmas. The northernmost edge of the snow ran from a Cotulla to Cuero to Sugar Land to Winnie line. Snowfall totals ranged from about an inch (in Pasadena) to around 12 inches (in Brazoria) across the region. An arctic cold front had pushed across Southeast Texas on Wednesday (December 22nd) dropping temperatures below freezing, so plenty of cold air was in place Christmas Eve when the snow began. What made this event unusual was not just the cold air being in place, but the depth of the cold air that was in place over the area. Before the heavy snow began on the night of Christmas Eve, the entire depth of the atmosphere over Southeast Texas was below freezing. Normally when winter weather events occur in Southeast Texas, the depth of the cold air is much shallower, resulting in ice (freezing rain or sleet) being a lot more common than snow. The morning of Christmas Eve, a strong upper level low was evident on satellite across northern Mexico. Ahead of this system, some snow began across Southeast Texas, but the dry atmosphere kept the snowfall light during the day, resulting in only trace amounts or a light dusting through late afternoon. Eventually, the atmosphere moistened up by late in the day as the upper level low approached from the west. The upper low moved across South Texas during the nighttime hours Christmas Eve, resulting in a band of heavy snowfall just north of the track of the system. The band of heaviest snowfall, about 20 miles wide, was centered from Victoria to Edna to Bay City to Lake Jackson. In this area, approximately 9 to 12 inches of snow fell. All areas south of a line from around Garwood to Needville to Friendswood to Texas City saw at least 3 inches of snow, with 4 inches falling on Galveston Island and 6 inches reported in Angleton and Alvin. North of this area, the snowfall totals dropped off rapidly. Snowfall totals of around an inch occurred in Clear Lake and Missouri City, with accumulations in Houston generally ranging from a dusting to around an inch. The heavier snowfall occurred over the coastal counties south of Houston because this area had more moisture in the atmosphere (being closer to the Gulf), and was also closer to the track of the upper level low. As you headed north and got north of Interstate 10, the atmosphere was too dry to support much more than just a few flurries.",,"PDS"

A ""hybrid"" surface low pressure system moved nearly straight east across the northern plains.  It tracked across northern South Dakota to Aberdeen, then toward Bemidji (MN) and Duluth.  A strong thermal gradient developed during the day on thursday (30th), with highs from around 20 near Cando, ND, to around 40 from Forman, ND, to Parkers Prairie, MN.  A swath of freezing rain fell first, coating many areas with a quarter inch of ice.  As the temperature fell, the freezing rain changed to snow.  The most snow, 6 to 10 inches, fell along the canadian border from Langdon to Pembina (ND) to Hallock to Roseau (MN).  Less snow fell south of this area, roughly 2 to 5 inches along the U.S. Highway 2 corridor.  Wind speeds did pick up as the low pressure system moved east, producing some visibility restrictions in blowing snow.  Quite a bit more snow fell north of the international border, prompting the closure of Manitoba Highways 75 and 59 north of the Pembina (ND) and Lancaster (MN) border crossings.  This stranded many Canadian hockey fans in Grand Forks (ND) and Thief River Falls (MN), who had been watching the men's (under age 20) International Hockey Federation tournament.  In Grand Forks, all motel rooms quickly filled up.  This prompted the American Red Cross to open a relief center in the Alerus Center, which supplied cots, blankets, and a breakfast to 385 people.  A semi-truck jacknifed near Joliette, ND, causing a 4 vehicle pileup behind it.  Three injured people were taken to a Grand Forks hospital.

Unusual in that the first round of heavy snow was not directly associated with the passage of a surface cyclone, but rather an area of strong forcing well ahead of the main area of low pressure, the storm nonetheless produced snow totals rivaling and exceeding those of the legendary Blizzard of January 1978 in some areas, crippling much of mainly southern portions of central Indiana, in some cases for several days. Fortunately for those affected, however, blizzard conditions were not produced thanks to winds much weaker than those accompanying the 1978 storm.The snow storm began during the very early morning hours of the 22nd, and continued through the day in south central Indiana.  By that evening heavy snow of 4 to nearly 10 inches had fallen, generally south of Interstate 70.  The greatest totals were in southern Indiana where approximately 10 inches had fallen.There was a sharp cutoff for this heavy snow.  Much of the state north of I-70 did not see any snow.  In the Indianapolis area, the Carmel and Brownsburg areas received no snow while the Greenwood area measured 4 inches.  During the evening of the 22nd, the second band of snow moved in as the surface low passed to the southeast of the state, blanketing all of central and southern Indiana.  Thundersnow was reported in several areas across central Indiana.  Snow of 4 to more than 18 inches fell from this next storm system.  Once again the heaviest snow fell in southern Indiana.  This brought the accumulation in much of southern Indiana to more than 20 inches with some spots reporting more than 30 inches of total snow by the afternoon of the 23rd.  Such snowfall amounts are historic not only in southern Indiana but for the entire state.Snowfall in northwestern portions of central Indiana was heavy at times, approaching 3 to 5 inches in Warren, Tippecanoe, Carroll, Clinton, Fountain, Vermillion, and Parke Counties.This epic snow storm closed I-64, I-65, I-74 and crippled I-70 in Indiana.  This stranded hundreds of motorists in their vehicles for hours and some for a few days.  A train derailment and collision also occurred in southern Indiana as a result of the snow. One hundred National Guardsmen were called out in some areas, especially in those areas where motorists were stranded.  Two blackhawk helicopters and 47 humvees were used in searching for stranded motorists.

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",,"PDS"

Total rainfall amounts ranged from 2 to 8 inches on the coastal plain to between 6 and 13 inches in the mountains. With such heavy rain, there were many hydrologic problems. Urban flooding was widespread across all of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Flash flooding was reported in Santa Barbara county along Highway 101 at the Gaviota and Winchester exits. In Los Angeles county, flash flooding and debris flows in the mountains and Santa Clarita valley closed down Interstate 5 and Hasley Canyon Road. In Rancho Palos Verdes, a mudslide on 25th Street trapped two vehicles. In the mountains of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, winter storm conditions prevailed.

The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan.

Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.

For the first time in recorded history, some areas experienced their first white Christmas. The northernmost edge of the snow ran from a Cotulla to Cuero to Sugar Land to Winnie line. Snowfall totals ranged from about an inch (in Pasadena) to around 12 inches (in Brazoria) across the region. An arctic cold front had pushed across Southeast Texas on Wednesday (December 22nd) dropping temperatures below freezing, so plenty of cold air was in place Christmas Eve when the snow began. What made this event unusual was not just the cold air being in place, but the depth of the cold air that was in place over the area. Before the heavy snow began on the night of Christmas Eve, the entire depth of the atmosphere over Southeast Texas was below freezing. Normally when winter weather events occur in Southeast Texas, the depth of the cold air is much shallower, resulting in ice (freezing rain or sleet) being a lot more common than snow. The morning of Christmas Eve, a strong upper level low was evident on satellite across northern Mexico. Ahead of this system, some snow began across Southeast Texas, but the dry atmosphere kept the snowfall light during the day, resulting in only trace amounts or a light dusting through late afternoon. Eventually, the atmosphere moistened up by late in the day as the upper level low approached from the west. The upper low moved across South Texas during the nighttime hours Christmas Eve, resulting in a band of heavy snowfall just north of the track of the system. The band of heaviest snowfall, about 20 miles wide, was centered from Victoria to Edna to Bay City to Lake Jackson. In this area, approximately 9 to 12 inches of snow fell. All areas south of a line from around Garwood to Needville to Friendswood to Texas City saw at least 3 inches of snow, with 4 inches falling on Galveston Island and 6 inches reported in Angleton and Alvin. North of this area, the snowfall totals dropped off rapidly. Snowfall totals of around an inch occurred in Clear Lake and Missouri City, with accumulations in Houston generally ranging from a dusting to around an inch. The heavier snowfall occurred over the coastal counties south of Houston because this area had more moisture in the atmosphere (being closer to the Gulf), and was also closer to the track of the upper level low. As you headed north and got north of Interstate 10, the atmosphere was too dry to support much more than just a few flurries.",,"PDS"

Tingting brought tropical storm conditions to Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan on the 28th, passing 70 miles northeast of Saipan with maximum winds of 70 mph near the center at 0600 SST that morning. Tingting became a typhoon later in the afternoon, then passed 65 miles southwest of Pagan Island with maximum winds of 90 mph at 2200 SST that evening. Both Pagan Island and Agrihan experienced typhoon conditions during that passage. Along with the high winds, all the islands received heavy rain, but Guam was especially hard hit, with phenomenal rainfall resulting in widespread flash flooding and property damage. Guam:  While Tropical Storm Tingting was still 250 miles or more east-northeast of Guam, peripheral rain bands brought record-breaking rainfall and widespread flash flooding to Guam. On the 27th through the morning of the 28th, over 20 inches of rain fell in 24 hours over much of the island. At Guam International Airport, 16.00 inches was recorded on June 27th, followed by 5.49 inches on the 28th. The maximum 24-hour rainfall was 18.80 inches, ending at 0600 SST on the 28th. At Inarajan in southern Guam, 21.85 inches was recorded by the automated station for the 24 hours ending at 0800 SST on the 28th. (It is worth noting that the previous wettest June on record, June of 1985, had a monthly total of 14.61 inches at the airport.) Rainfall was somewhat less over northeastern Guam, where 11.33 inches fell at Andersen AFB in the 30 hours ending at 1000 SST on the 28th. Even though Tingting never came closer to Guam than 200 miles, strong monsoon flow associated with the peripheral rain band brought tropical storm force winds to Guam, mainly late on the 27th through the morning of the 28th. At Guam International Airport, the highest sustained wind of 44 mph came on the 28th at 0454 SST, and the peak gust was 58 mph at 0241 SST. The highest sustained wind on Guam was 51 mph at Andersen AFB on the 28th at 0959 SST, while the highest observed gust was 66 mph at the Inarajan automated station on the 28th at 0251 SST. The lowest pressure recorded on Guam was 994.6 mb at Andersen AFB on the 28th at 0356 SST. Rota:  After passing 160 miles northeast of Rota around 0600 SST the morning of the 28th, Tingting delivered its strongest winds to Rota later that afternoon. At Rota International Airport, the highest sustained wind was 44 mph from the west-southwest at 1455 SST, while the peak gust of 58 mph from the southwest was recorded at 1550 SST. The automated station at the airport recorded 5.72 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 2251 SST on the 27th, and 8.74 inches total for the 27th and 28th. The lowest reported sea-level pressure at the automated station was 992.3 mb at 0451 SST on the 28th.Tinian:  The observer at Tinian Airport does not report rainfall or sea-level pressure, and is only there part-time. The highest reported sustained wind of 35 mph occurred several times: from the west on the 28th at 0850 SST, at 1150 SST, and at 1250 SST; and from the southwest at 1855 SST. The highest reported gust was 52 mph from the southwest on the 28th at 1855 SST. Saipan:  At Saipan International Airport, the maximum sustained wind of 62 mph and the peak gust of 77 mph were both from the southwest, on the 28th at 1806 SST, about 12 hours after Tingting's closest approach. In the 24 hours ending at 2354 SST on the 28th, 7.78 inches of rain fell. The lowest sea-level pressure was 984.9 mb, recorded at 0654 and 0754 SST on the 28th. Pagan Island:  The automated station on Pagan recorded both the maximum sustained wind of 66 mph and the peak gust of 132 mph from the east-northeast at 0200 SST on the 29th. The lowest sea-level pressure of 973.6 mb occurred an hour earlier, at 0100 SST. STORM EFFECTS AND DAMAGEGuam:  While Guam did experience a short period of minimal tropical storm force winds, nearly all of the damage arose from the extraordinary rainfall and the resultant flooding and mudslides. Crop damage amounted to about $500,000, with most farmers reporting a total crop loss. Fifty-seven homes suffered major damage from mudslides and inundation, rendering them unlivable, and another 624 homes had minor damage. A road in Santa Rita collapsed as a pickup truck was crossing over it, damaging the truck. In southeastern Guam, a man died after driving his sport utility vehicle into water several feet deep at the Ylig River bridge in Yona. Total damage is estimated at $6,000,000. Rota:  As with Guam, most of the damage on Rota resulted from heavy rain and high seas. High seas inflicted an estimated $1 million in damage on Rota's commercial port. The combined cost of debris cleanup and repairs to roads and bridges amounted to about $762,000, and crop loss was estimated at up to $500,000. No major damage was reported to homes, businesses or schools. Total loss:  about $2,262,000. Tinian/Saipan:  In contrast to Guam and Rota, high winds accounted for much of the damage to Tinian and Saipan. On Tinian, 4 homes were destroyed and another 24 suffered major damage. On Saipan, 4 homes were destroyed, 81 had major damage, and 101 homes had only minor damage. Only minor damage was done to the public schools on both islands. At the Saipan seaport, a derelict fishing vessel containing thousands of gallons of diesel fuel and oil sank during the storm. Over $300,000 in damage was done to Saipan's power system, with over 50 lines, 20 transformers and 6 poles needing repair or replacement. Crop loss amounted to about $518,000, with 90% of the banana trees being blown down. Total damage is estimated at $2,400,000. Alamagan/Pagan/Agrihan: All private homes on these islands were destroyed (about 6 total), all crops and stored food were lost, and the water supply was contaminated. On Agrihan, the main public facility, used as a dispensary, radio room, food closet and storm shelter, was heavily damaged. On Alamagan, the mayor's office radio antenna was blown away and never found. Total damage is about $500,000. Total damage for this typhoon/flash flood event is $11,162,000. Seven fatalities are associated with this event: 1 man was killed after driving into deep floodwater on Guam (see above), a man drowned in high surf on Guam the morning of the 28th (see separate event entry), and 5 men drowned while kayaking in Guam's rough waters on the 29th (see separate event entry).",,"PDS"

Later in the morning high winds downed trees and tree limbs in the McMinnville, Amity and western Salem areas, with power outages for 2600 customers. At 10 AM Astoria Building Inspector Jim Byerley was struck by lightning crossing a street in downtown Astoria. He was shaken and sore, examined at Columbia Memorial Hospital and released. Heavy rain accompanied this storm, resulting in a mud and rock slide that closed Oregon Highway 36 near Triangle Lake for a day.  The storm dumped heavy snow in the Mt Hood area, where one and a half to two feet of new snow was reported. The storm also generated high seas, which created high surf along the Northern and Central Oregon Coast the next day.

For the first time in recorded history, some areas experienced their first white Christmas. The northernmost edge of the snow ran from a Cotulla to Cuero to Sugar Land to Winnie line. Snowfall totals ranged from about an inch (in Pasadena) to around 12 inches (in Brazoria) across the region. An arctic cold front had pushed across Southeast Texas on Wednesday (December 22nd) dropping temperatures below freezing, so plenty of cold air was in place Christmas Eve when the snow began. What made this event unusual was not just the cold air being in place, but the depth of the cold air that was in place over the area. Before the heavy snow began on the night of Christmas Eve, the entire depth of the atmosphere over Southeast Texas was below freezing. Normally when winter weather events occur in Southeast Texas, the depth of the cold air is much shallower, resulting in ice (freezing rain or sleet) being a lot more common than snow. The morning of Christmas Eve, a strong upper level low was evident on satellite across northern Mexico. Ahead of this system, some snow began across Southeast Texas, but the dry atmosphere kept the snowfall light during the day, resulting in only trace amounts or a light dusting through late afternoon. Eventually, the atmosphere moistened up by late in the day as the upper level low approached from the west. The upper low moved across South Texas during the nighttime hours Christmas Eve, resulting in a band of heavy snowfall just north of the track of the system. The band of heaviest snowfall, about 20 miles wide, was centered from Victoria to Edna to Bay City to Lake Jackson. In this area, approximately 9 to 12 inches of snow fell. All areas south of a line from around Garwood to Needville to Friendswood to Texas City saw at least 3 inches of snow, with 4 inches falling on Galveston Island and 6 inches reported in Angleton and Alvin. North of this area, the snowfall totals dropped off rapidly. Snowfall totals of around an inch occurred in Clear Lake and Missouri City, with accumulations in Houston generally ranging from a dusting to around an inch. The heavier snowfall occurred over the coastal counties south of Houston because this area had more moisture in the atmosphere (being closer to the Gulf), and was also closer to the track of the upper level low. As you headed north and got north of Interstate 10, the atmosphere was too dry to support much more than just a few flurries.",,"PDS"

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",,"PDS"

A strong thermal gradient developed during the day on thursday (30th), with highs from around 20 near Cando, ND, to around 40 from Forman, ND, to Parkers Prairie, MN.  A swath of freezing rain fell first, coating many areas with a quarter inch of ice.  As the temperature fell, the freezing rain changed to snow.  The most snow, 6 to 10 inches, fell along the canadian border from Langdon to Pembina (ND) to Hallock to Roseau (MN).  Less snow fell south of this area, roughly 2 to 5 inches along the U.S. Highway 2 corridor.  Wind speeds did pick up as the low pressure system moved east, producing some visibility restrictions in blowing snow.  Quite a bit more snow fell north of the international border, prompting the closure of Manitoba Highways 75 and 59 north of the Pembina (ND) and Lancaster (MN) border crossings.  This stranded many Canadian hockey fans in Grand Forks (ND) and Thief River Falls (MN), who had been watching the men's (under age 20) International Hockey Federation tournament.  In Grand Forks, all motel rooms quickly filled up.  This prompted the American Red Cross to open a relief center in the Alerus Center, which supplied cots, blankets, and a breakfast to 385 people.  A semi-truck jacknifed near Joliette, ND, causing a 4 vehicle pileup behind it.  Three injured people were taken to a Grand Forks hospital.

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.   Approximately 75% of the damage was estimated to be related to wind - $11.8 million.  Approximately 25% of the storm damage was estimated to be related to storm surge - $4.0 million.",,"PDS"

Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees.

The heavy rain and melting snow resulted in excessive runoff in many areas  from Williams to Flagstaff to Winslow and south to Prescott and Black Canyon City. High water, mudslides, and rock slides resulted in numerous road closures and evacuations in the area. Many creeks experienced significant rises. Oak Creak near Sedona exceeded bank full for a few hours when it rose 14 feet on the 29th and the Little Colorado River reached bankfull near Winslow. Some storm total rainfall amounts were: Flagstaff 3.83 inches, Crown King 4.73 inches, Sedona 4.06 inches, Winslow 0.54 inches, Payson 2.88 inches. Flagstaff received it's second largest calendar day precipitation on record. Seventy people were evacuated in southwest Flagstaff when water over-topped an earthen flood control dam. A dozen neighborhoods (about 300 people) along Oak Creek were evacuated in the Sedona area and two neighborhoods down stream.  A 14 mile section of Highway 89 between Flagstaff and Sedona was closed because of rock slides. High water on the Verde River forced evacuations in Cornville andBridgeport. Four RVs were lost in Oak Creek at the Page Springs RV park while 23 vehicles were removed before the water rose too high. About 100 people were evacuated in Black Canyon City in two different mobile-home parks. Portions of Navajo Route 71 and Old Navajo Route 2 were closed northeast of Winslow when the Little Colorado River overflowed the banks. Six families were evacuated near Bird Springs on the Navajo Reservation. All thirty-one low water crossings and seven other streets were closed in Prescott due to flooding.

For the first time in recorded history, some areas experienced their first white Christmas. The northernmost edge of the snow ran from a Cotulla to Cuero to Sugar Land to Winnie line. Snowfall totals ranged from about an inch (in Pasadena) to around 12 inches (in Brazoria) across the region. An arctic cold front had pushed across Southeast Texas on Wednesday (December 22nd) dropping temperatures below freezing, so plenty of cold air was in place Christmas Eve when the snow began. What made this event unusual was not just the cold air being in place, but the depth of the cold air that was in place over the area. Before the heavy snow began on the night of Christmas Eve, the entire depth of the atmosphere over Southeast Texas was below freezing. Normally when winter weather events occur in Southeast Texas, the depth of the cold air is much shallower, resulting in ice (freezing rain or sleet) being a lot more common than snow. The morning of Christmas Eve, a strong upper level low was evident on satellite across northern Mexico. Ahead of this system, some snow began across Southeast Texas, but the dry atmosphere kept the snowfall light during the day, resulting in only trace amounts or a light dusting through late afternoon. Eventually, the atmosphere moistened up by late in the day as the upper level low approached from the west. The upper low moved across South Texas during the nighttime hours Christmas Eve, resulting in a band of heavy snowfall just north of the track of the system. The band of heaviest snowfall, about 20 miles wide, was centered from Victoria to Edna to Bay City to Lake Jackson. In this area, approximately 9 to 12 inches of snow fell. All areas south of a line from around Garwood to Needville to Friendswood to Texas City saw at least 3 inches of snow, with 4 inches falling on Galveston Island and 6 inches reported in Angleton and Alvin. North of this area, the snowfall totals dropped off rapidly. Snowfall totals of around an inch occurred in Clear Lake and Missouri City, with accumulations in Houston generally ranging from a dusting to around an inch. The heavier snowfall occurred over the coastal counties south of Houston because this area had more moisture in the atmosphere (being closer to the Gulf), and was also closer to the track of the upper level low. As you headed north and got north of Interstate 10, the atmosphere was too dry to support much more than just a few flurries.",,"PDS"

Late on the 4th and into the 5th, a low pressure wave lifted northeast, along this boundary, and through the Ohio River Valley.Rains of 1.5 to 3.3 inches fell on saturated ground, during about a 36 hour time span.  One rain maximum extended northeast from the Scioto River Valley, across the northern half of Perry County, then continued northeast into the Muskingum River Valley.  Another maximum of rain extended out of central Vinton County, across central Athens County, and into central and northern Washington County.  McArthur measured 3.3 inches of rain for the event.  Other rain measurements from cooperative observers included 2.6 inches at Athens, 2.3 inches at McConnelsville, 2.2 inches from Nelsonville, 2 inches at Marietta, 1.9 inches at Beverly, 1.6 inches from both New Lexington and Jackson.     Widespread small stream flooding occurred on Sunday the 4th and Monday the 5th.  In Jackson County, the stream flooding was limited to townships near the Vinton County border.  Water was 2 to 3 feet deep in the streets of Glenford of northern Perry County.  Water and debris forced numerous road closures.   As the water receded, cleanup was complicated by some ice formation. River flooding followed on the Muskingum, the Hocking, and on the Ohio.  The swollen rivers also caused feeder streams to have backwater flooding.  During the morning of the 5th, the Muskingum River crested at McConnelsville of Morgan County around 12.7 feet.  Flood stage is 11 feet.  This was the highest water level at McConnelsville since the 12.8 feet back in August, 1980.  About 27 homes and 1 business along the river in Morgan County sustained at least major damage.  All total, about 77 homes in Morgan County, were affected to some degree.         At Athens, the Hocking River crested around 21.3 feet about midday on the 6th.  Flood stage is 20 feet.  The floods of 1997 and 1998 were higher at Athens.  The county engineer reported about a dozen road slippages and a dozen road washouts on roads in Athens County.  Near dawn on the 6th, York Township firemen rescued a woman whose vehicle was washed into the Hocking River from County Route 4.  She called 911 on her cell phone, while the water was rushing into her vehicle.  She got outside and on to the roof, but was swept off the vehicle by the rushing water.   She was in the water for nearly 45 minutes, with air temperatures in the 20s.  When rescued by boat, her head was poking out of the water and one arm was hanging on to a brush pile.  The fire chief commented, about how lucky she was.  He said the spot where she drove into the water is usually a dead zone for cell phone service, but somehow she got a signal.      The Ohio River crested at Marietta at 36.8 feet during the afternoon of the 6th.  Flood stage is 34 feet.  The flood of January 1996 crested at 39.3 feet.

The heavy rain and melting snow resulted in excessive runoff in many areas  from Williams to Flagstaff to Winslow and south to Prescott and Black Canyon City. High water, mudslides, and rock slides resulted in numerous road closures and evacuations in the area. Many creeks experienced significant rises. Oak Creak near Sedona exceeded bank full for a few hours when it rose 14 feet on the 29th and the Little Colorado River reached bankfull near Winslow. Some storm total rainfall amounts were: Flagstaff 3.83 inches, Crown King 4.73 inches, Sedona 4.06 inches, Winslow 0.54 inches, Payson 2.88 inches. Flagstaff received it's second largest calendar day precipitation on record. Seventy people were evacuated in southwest Flagstaff when water over-topped an earthen flood control dam. A dozen neighborhoods (about 300 people) along Oak Creek were evacuated in the Sedona area and two neighborhoods down stream.

Snowfall totals of 20 inches or more were found along a line generally running from Eaton to Greenville, Piqua, Sidney, and Bellefontaine. Along and west of the I-71 corridor between Cincinnati and Columbus...over 8 inches of snow fell. East of this line, warm air infiltrated the lower layers of the atmosphere and brought periods of freezing rain and sleet during the evening and overnight hours. A quarter inch or more of ice occurred along a line from Batavia to Hillsboro, to Circleville and Newark. Several communities in south central and central Ohio were crippled by power outages. Up to 236,000 electric customers were without power for several hours, some lasting up to a week before it was restored. At one point in time, 90% of Highland county was without power, and parts of Adams county were without water for a week. The Ohio Insurance Agency estimated the damage to all of Ohio from this storm to be on the order of 85 million dollars, including over 25 million dollars in property damage.",,"PDS"

Unusual in that the first round of heavy snow was not directly associated with the passage of a surface cyclone, but rather an area of strong forcing well ahead of the main area of low pressure, the storm nonetheless produced snow totals rivaling and exceeding those of the legendary Blizzard of January 1978 in some areas, crippling much of mainly southern portions of central Indiana, in some cases for several days. Fortunately for those affected, however, blizzard conditions were not produced thanks to winds much weaker than those accompanying the 1978 storm.The snow storm began during the very early morning hours of the 22nd, and continued through the day in south central Indiana.  By that evening heavy snow of 4 to nearly 10 inches had fallen, generally south of Interstate 70.  The greatest totals were in southern Indiana where approximately 10 inches had fallen.There was a sharp cutoff for this heavy snow.  Much of the state north of I-70 did not see any snow.  In the Indianapolis area, the Carmel and Brownsburg areas received no snow while the Greenwood area measured 4 inches.  During the evening of the 22nd, the second band of snow moved in as the surface low passed to the southeast of the state, blanketing all of central and southern Indiana.  Thundersnow was reported in several areas across central Indiana.  Snow of 4 to more than 18 inches fell from this next storm system.  Once again the heaviest snow fell in southern Indiana.  This brought the accumulation in much of southern Indiana to more than 20 inches with some spots reporting more than 30 inches of total snow by the afternoon of the 23rd.  Such snowfall amounts are historic not only in southern Indiana but for the entire state.Snowfall in northwestern portions of central Indiana was heavy at times, approaching 3 to 5 inches in Warren, Tippecanoe, Carroll, Clinton, Fountain, Vermillion, and Parke Counties.This epic snow storm closed I-64, I-65, I-74 and crippled I-70 in Indiana.  This stranded hundreds of motorists in their vehicles for hours and some for a few days.  A train derailment and collision also occurred in southern Indiana as a result of the snow. One hundred National Guardsmen were called out in some areas, especially in those areas where motorists were stranded.  Two blackhawk helicopters and 47 humvees were used in searching for stranded motorists.  Statewide, 200 property damage auto accidents were reported, along with 1,000 slide-offs, according to the Indianapolis Star. Several rescues were necessary.

Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding.

Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",,"PDS"

State highway crews were pulled off the roads in Spencer County after three salt trucks overturned on icy roads and a fourth went into a ditch. A fatal accident occurred on Interstate 64 on the Wabash River bridge at the Illinois state line. A van heading eastbound spun out of control on the bridge. A Mexican man and woman in the van died shortly after the wreck when a tractor-trailer rig struck them and the van (indirect fatalities). Several others in the van were not injured. In Chandler, a man was found dead in his vehicle after he had been spreading ice melt on his driveway (indirect fatality). The coroner suspected weather may have contributed to his death. Scattered power outages were reported throughout southwest Indiana as brisk winds brought down ice-laden tree limbs. Thousands of homes were without power. About 12,000 customers were without power on the east side of Evansville for about 90 minutes when ice brought down a transformer line. Another large power outage was in Boonville, where about 2,000 utility customers were affected. Evansville Regional Airport was closed for about three hours. Hospital emergency rooms reported numerous slip-and-fall injuries on the ice. The volume of accident calls was so great that towing companies were unable to keep up with the demand for help.

Fortunately for those affected, however, blizzard conditions were not produced thanks to winds much weaker than those accompanying the 1978 storm.The snow storm began during the very early morning hours of the 22nd, and continued through the day in south central Indiana.  By that evening heavy snow of 4 to nearly 10 inches had fallen, generally south of Interstate 70.  The greatest totals were in southern Indiana where approximately 10 inches had fallen.There was a sharp cutoff for this heavy snow.  Much of the state north of I-70 did not see any snow.  In the Indianapolis area, the Carmel and Brownsburg areas received no snow while the Greenwood area measured 4 inches.  During the evening of the 22nd, the second band of snow moved in as the surface low passed to the southeast of the state, blanketing all of central and southern Indiana.  Thundersnow was reported in several areas across central Indiana.  Snow of 4 to more than 18 inches fell from this next storm system.  Once again the heaviest snow fell in southern Indiana.  This brought the accumulation in much of southern Indiana to more than 20 inches with some spots reporting more than 30 inches of total snow by the afternoon of the 23rd.  Such snowfall amounts are historic not only in southern Indiana but for the entire state.Snowfall in northwestern portions of central Indiana was heavy at times, approaching 3 to 5 inches in Warren, Tippecanoe, Carroll, Clinton, Fountain, Vermillion, and Parke Counties.This epic snow storm closed I-64, I-65, I-74 and crippled I-70 in Indiana.  This stranded hundreds of motorists in their vehicles for hours and some for a few days.  A train derailment and collision also occurred in southern Indiana as a result of the snow. One hundred National Guardsmen were called out in some areas, especially in those areas where motorists were stranded.  Two blackhawk helicopters and 47 humvees were used in searching for stranded motorists.  Statewide, 200 property damage auto accidents were reported, along with 1,000 slide-offs, according to the Indianapolis Star. Several rescues were necessary.

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",,"PDS"

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",,"PDS"

A rare combination of weather events developed last week that produced several inches of snowfall, which in itself is quite rare in this region. However, to have snow fall on Christmas Eve and morning is a historical first according to the more than 150 years of weather data. This White Christmas is certainly one for the record books.The freezing temperatures and snowfall were expected in South Texas and National Weather Service Offices were talking about the arrival of unseasonably cold temperatures prior to the holiday. Snowfall was mentioned as a possibility and as Christmas drew closer, snowfall became more likely as the weather forecast became more focused. We need to look back to the week before Christmas in order to recap the details of this historic event. Signals from the numerical weather forecast models suggested a strong cold front and arctic air mass would move southward along the Rocky Mountains into Texas and eventually over the Lower Texas Coast. This cold front moved through Brownsville, Wednesday afternoon (12/22/2004). A second reinforcing surge of arctic air followed the initial front, dropping temperatures into the 30s and low 40s late Thursday (12/23/2004). Maximum temperatures on Friday (12/24/2004) were in the upper 30s to low 40s across the Rio Grande Valley. Widespread moderate rain covered much of the area with most locations reporting one half of an inch to nearly one inch of liquid precipitation. The cold rain began to taper off on Christmas Eve as temperatures began to fall below freezing. With the cold air trapped at the surface and wedged against the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental, an upper level low with Pacific moisture was moving east across Northern Mexico. Initially, reports of ice and sleet were received by the National Weather Service in Brownsville.  The moisture and upward vertical motion generated by this upper level system caused snow to begin falling across Deep South Texas after 10 PM CST. The snow fall persisted through midnight into Christmas morning and eventually ended around 4 AM on (12/25/2004) leaving behind the first White Christmas ever recording in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and most likely the first White Christmas ever in extreme Northeast Mexico.

The snow continued during the day on the 30th, and tapered off from west to east across the area during the evening.  The snow was accompanied by northwest wind of 20 to 30 mph with gusts to around 45 mph.  The strong wind produced considerable blowing and drifting snow which continued into the pre dawn hours of the 31st.  Many areas had a period of freezing rain and sleet at the onset of the storm which produced a layer of ice.  Snowfall amounts generally ranged from 2 to 7 inches across northeast Montana.  There were numerous reports of significant blowing and drifting snow, and several reports of snowdrifts that were 3 to 4 feet deep. By the evening of the 30th many roads were either closed or open to emergency travel only.  The wind also combined with temperatures that were in the single digits to produce wind chills of 15 to 30 below zero.",,"PDS"

It became a tropical storm early on the 14th, and appeared to be headed safely away from Yap. However, Tropical Storm Dianmu slowed abruptly and turned to an east-northeast track. Dianmu dealt Yap a glancing blow, passing about 75 miles northwest of that island as a 65 mph tropical storm at about 0400 SST on the 15th. Meanwhile, southwest monsoon flow into Dianmu brought gusty winds and heavy rain to Palau on the 13th and 14th.  By 1300 SST on the 15th, Dianmu was a typhoon, centered over 150 miles north of Yap and moving quickly away.At Yap, the highest 2-minute wind was 32 mph;  from the south-southwest on the 14th at 2353 SST, and from the west-southwest on the 15th at 0650 SST. The maximum gust of 59 mph from the south-southwest was recorded at 2253 SST on the 14th. Since Yap spent most of its time in a dry slot between Dianmu's central cloud mass and its outer rain band, the greatest 24-hour rainfall at the airport was only 0.56 inches through 1600 SST on the 15th. The lowest sea-level pressure at the airport was 998.3 mb at 0457 SST on the 15th. No damage or injuries were reported at Yap.While Palau had less wind than Yap, much more rain fell there as a result of persistent monsoon flow into Dianmu. The maximum 24-hour rainfall was 5.22 inches through 1300 SST on the 14th, while 7.19 inches fell in the 48 hours ending at 0400 SST on the 15th, resulting in minor flooding. The highest 2-minute wind was only 21 mph on the 14th, while the peak gusts of 44 mph were recorded at the Weather Service Office on the 15th at 0902 SST and 1659 SST.

Less snow fell south of this area, roughly 2 to 5 inches along the U.S. Highway 2 corridor.  Wind speeds did pick up as the low pressure system moved east, producing some visibility restrictions in blowing snow.

A rare combination of weather events developed last week that produced several inches of snowfall, which in itself is quite rare in this region. However, to have snow fall on Christmas Eve and morning is a historical first according to the more than 150 years of weather data. This White Christmas is certainly one for the record books.The freezing temperatures and snowfall were expected in South Texas and National Weather Service Offices were talking about the arrival of unseasonably cold temperatures prior to the holiday. Snowfall was mentioned as a possibility and as Christmas drew closer, snowfall became more likely as the weather forecast became more focused. We need to look back to the week before Christmas in order to recap the details of this historic event. Signals from the numerical weather forecast models suggested a strong cold front and arctic air mass would move southward along the Rocky Mountains into Texas and eventually over the Lower Texas Coast. This cold front moved through Brownsville, Wednesday afternoon (12/22/2004). A second reinforcing surge of arctic air followed the initial front, dropping temperatures into the 30s and low 40s late Thursday (12/23/2004). Maximum temperatures on Friday (12/24/2004) were in the upper 30s to low 40s across the Rio Grande Valley. Widespread moderate rain covered much of the area with most locations reporting one half of an inch to nearly one inch of liquid precipitation.

Unusual in that the first round of heavy snow was not directly associated with the passage of a surface cyclone, but rather an area of strong forcing well ahead of the main area of low pressure, the storm nonetheless produced snow totals rivaling and exceeding those of the legendary Blizzard of January 1978 in some areas, crippling much of mainly southern portions of central Indiana, in some cases for several days. Fortunately for those affected, however, blizzard conditions were not produced thanks to winds much weaker than those accompanying the 1978 storm.The snow storm began during the very early morning hours of the 22nd, and continued through the day in south central Indiana.  By that evening heavy snow of 4 to nearly 10 inches had fallen, generally south of Interstate 70.  The greatest totals were in southern Indiana where approximately 10 inches had fallen.There was a sharp cutoff for this heavy snow.  Much of the state north of I-70 did not see any snow.  In the Indianapolis area, the Carmel and Brownsburg areas received no snow while the Greenwood area measured 4 inches.  During the evening of the 22nd, the second band of snow moved in as the surface low passed to the southeast of the state, blanketing all of central and southern Indiana.  Thundersnow was reported in several areas across central Indiana.  Snow of 4 to more than 18 inches fell from this next storm system.  Once again the heaviest snow fell in southern Indiana.  This brought the accumulation in much of southern Indiana to more than 20 inches with some spots reporting more than 30 inches of total snow by the afternoon of the 23rd.  Such snowfall amounts are historic not only in southern Indiana but for the entire state.Snowfall in northwestern portions of central Indiana was heavy at times, approaching 3 to 5 inches in Warren, Tippecanoe, Carroll, Clinton, Fountain, Vermillion, and Parke Counties.This epic snow storm closed I-64, I-65, I-74 and crippled I-70 in Indiana.  This stranded hundreds of motorists in their vehicles for hours and some for a few days.  A train derailment and collision also occurred in southern Indiana as a result of the snow. One hundred National Guardsmen were called out in some areas, especially in those areas where motorists were stranded.  Two blackhawk helicopters and 47 humvees were used in searching for stranded motorists.  Statewide, 200 property damage auto accidents were reported, along with 1,000 slide-offs, according to the Indianapolis Star. Several rescues were necessary.

Chaba moved west-northwest, then west over the next two days, and was upgraded to a typhoon late on the 21st, about 350 miles east of the Mariana Islands. From that point, Typhoon Chaba moved almost straight west and intensified steadily, moving through the Mariana Islands between Rota and Tinian at about 2230 SST the evening of the 22nd with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. Chaba brought typhoon conditions to Rota and Tinian, and tropical storm conditions to Guam and Saipan. Heavy rain and minor flooding occurred on all the islands.Guam:  At Guam International Airport, the highest sustained wind, 48 mph, was recorded at 2254 SST on the 22nd. The peak gust was 66 mph from the southwest, at 2248 SST on the 22nd, and again at 0318 SST on the 23rd. The highest sustained wind anywhere on the island was 58 mph from the west-northwest at Andersen AFB, at 1929 SST on the 22nd. The automated station at Apra Harbor reported the highest gust, 79 mph from the southwest, at 0451 SST on the 23rd. The greatest 24-hour rainfall was at the airport, where 8.89 inches fell in the 24 hours ending at 0600 SST on the 23rd. Heavy rain continued over the next two days, bringing the 3-day total for the 22nd-24th to 12.95 inches. The lowest observed sea-level pressure on the island was 991.6 mb at Andersen AFB at 2355 SST on the 22nd. Rota:  Chaba's 50-mile-diameter eye passed 25 miles north-northeast of Rota at about 2230 SST on the evening of the 22nd, keeping the 10-mile-thick eyewall over the island for several hours. The highest sustained wind and peak gust reported by the automated station at Rota Airport were 66 mph and 136 mph, both on the observation for 2051 SST on the 22nd. The sustained wind value is likely too low, based on reports of  sustained winds less than 10 mph in the next few hours while the eyewall was over Rota. A noteworthy feature of Chaba's passage over Rota is that gusts of 100 mph or more were registered on ten consecutive hourly observations, from 1951 SST on the 22nd to 0451 SST on the 23rd. Following the 136 mph gust at 2051 SST, the following 5 hours had peak gusts of 132 mph, 129 mph, 135 mph, 133 mph and 135 mph.The automated station at the airport recorded 12.26 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 0451 SST on the 23rd. Another 8.54 inches of rain fell between 0200 SST and 1800 SST on the 24th. The lowest reported sea-level pressure was 952.8 mb at 2351 SST on the 22nd.Tinian:  The observer at Tinian Airport does not report rainfall or sea-level pressure, and is only there part-time. The highest reported sustained wind and peak gust were 58 mph and 81 mph, both from the northeast at 1950 SST on the 22nd. After that time, the observing station was closed for the night. Saipan:  At Saipan International Airport, the maximum sustained wind was 62 mph from the southeast at 2257 SST on the 22nd. The peak gust, 70 mph from the southeast, occurred a little earlier at 2205 SST. In the 24 hours ending at 0354 SST on the 23rd, 6.33 inches of rain fell. The lowest sea-level pressure was 985.6 mb at 2254 SST on the 22nd. Pagan Island:  The automated station on Pagan recorded a maximum sustained wind of 39 mph from the east-southeast at 1300 SST on the 22nd, and a peak gust of 70 mph from the east later that afternoon at 1600 SST. The lowest sea-level pressure of 999.4 mb occurred the following day, at 1500 SST on the 23rd. In the 24 hours ending at 1000 SST on the 23rd, Pagan recorded only 0.57 inches of rain. STORM EFFECTS AND DAMAGEGuam:  Coastal inundation was reported up to 6 feet, but it caused no significant damage. One person was swept over the reef and drowned the day after the typhoon, and 4 minor injuries were reported. Beach erosion was light, and only minor flooding resulted from the heavy rain. No major damage was reported from the high winds. Rota:  Damage was extensive, with over 50 homes totally destroyed and over 175 suffering major damage. Many power poles and line were blown down, resulting in an island-wide power outage. Vegetation, trees and crops were also heavily damaged. Coastal inundation of 8 to 11 feet resulted in heavy beach erosion. There were no fatalities, and only a few minor injuries reported. Tinian/Saipan:  Coastal inundation was reported at 6 to 8 feet, resulting in moderate beach erosion. The day before the typhoon, a man was swept over the reef and drowned. About 270 homes were destroyed on the two islands, with over 700 suffering major damage. Falling trees damaged several cars on Saipan.

According to newspaper accounts, operations at the Reno/Tahoe International Airport were suspended late on the 30th to allow for the sanding and deicing of the main runway.  According to an airport spokesperson, this was only the second time in 40 years that the airport had been shut down.  A total of 25 flights were canceled on the 30th and 31st as a result of the heavy snowfall.In Nevada, the cities of Reno and Sparks, and Washoe County, issued states of emergency on the 30th.  This was to allow for the plowing of major streets, and to assist in the use of emergency vehicles.  According to a newspaper account, Nevada's governor sent all non-essential government employees home by noon on the 31st.Structural damage was experienced as the heavy snowfall caused many carports to collapse, often damaging the automobiles beneath them.  Insurance officials reported that claims were already being made for roof damage.  However, more claims would undoubtedly be made after the snowfall had a chance to melt and revealed additional damage.

Unusual in that the first round of heavy snow was not directly associated with the passage of a surface cyclone, but rather an area of strong forcing well ahead of the main area of low pressure, the storm nonetheless produced snow totals rivaling and exceeding those of the legendary Blizzard of January 1978 in some areas, crippling much of mainly southern portions of central Indiana, in some cases for several days. Fortunately for those affected, however, blizzard conditions were not produced thanks to winds much weaker than those accompanying the 1978 storm.The snow storm began during the very early morning hours of the 22nd, and continued through the day in south central Indiana.  By that evening heavy snow of 4 to nearly 10 inches had fallen, generally south of Interstate 70.  The greatest totals were in southern Indiana where approximately 10 inches had fallen.There was a sharp cutoff for this heavy snow.  Much of the state north of I-70 did not see any snow.  In the Indianapolis area, the Carmel and Brownsburg areas received no snow while the Greenwood area measured 4 inches.  During the evening of the 22nd, the second band of snow moved in as the surface low passed to the southeast of the state, blanketing all of central and southern Indiana.  Thundersnow was reported in several areas across central Indiana.  Snow of 4 to more than 18 inches fell from this next storm system.  Once again the heaviest snow fell in southern Indiana.  This brought the accumulation in much of southern Indiana to more than 20 inches with some spots reporting more than 30 inches of total snow by the afternoon of the 23rd.  Such snowfall amounts are historic not only in southern Indiana but for the entire state.Snowfall in northwestern portions of central Indiana was heavy at times, approaching 3 to 5 inches in Warren, Tippecanoe, Carroll, Clinton, Fountain, Vermillion, and Parke Counties.This epic snow storm closed I-64, I-65, I-74 and crippled I-70 in Indiana.  This stranded hundreds of motorists in their vehicles for hours and some for a few days.  A train derailment and collision also occurred in southern Indiana as a result of the snow. One hundred National Guardsmen were called out in some areas, especially in those areas where motorists were stranded.  Two blackhawk helicopters and 47 humvees were used in searching for stranded motorists.  Statewide, 200 property damage auto accidents were reported, along with 1,000 slide-offs, according to the Indianapolis Star. Several rescues were necessary.

Unusual in that the first round of heavy snow was not directly associated with the passage of a surface cyclone, but rather an area of strong forcing well ahead of the main area of low pressure, the storm nonetheless produced snow totals rivaling and exceeding those of the legendary Blizzard of January 1978 in some areas, crippling much of mainly southern portions of central Indiana, in some cases for several days. Fortunately for those affected, however, blizzard conditions were not produced thanks to winds much weaker than those accompanying the 1978 storm.The snow storm began during the very early morning hours of the 22nd, and continued through the day in south central Indiana.  By that evening heavy snow of 4 to nearly 10 inches had fallen, generally south of Interstate 70.  The greatest totals were in southern Indiana where approximately 10 inches had fallen.There was a sharp cutoff for this heavy snow.  Much of the state north of I-70 did not see any snow.  In the Indianapolis area, the Carmel and Brownsburg areas received no snow while the Greenwood area measured 4 inches.  During the evening of the 22nd, the second band of snow moved in as the surface low passed to the southeast of the state, blanketing all of central and southern Indiana.  Thundersnow was reported in several areas across central Indiana.  Snow of 4 to more than 18 inches fell from this next storm system.  Once again the heaviest snow fell in southern Indiana.  This brought the accumulation in much of southern Indiana to more than 20 inches with some spots reporting more than 30 inches of total snow by the afternoon of the 23rd.  Such snowfall amounts are historic not only in southern Indiana but for the entire state.Snowfall in northwestern portions of central Indiana was heavy at times, approaching 3 to 5 inches in Warren, Tippecanoe, Carroll, Clinton, Fountain, Vermillion, and Parke Counties.This epic snow storm closed I-64, I-65, I-74 and crippled I-70 in Indiana.  This stranded hundreds of motorists in their vehicles for hours and some for a few days.  A train derailment and collision also occurred in southern Indiana as a result of the snow. One hundred National Guardsmen were called out in some areas, especially in those areas where motorists were stranded.  Two blackhawk helicopters and 47 humvees were used in searching for stranded motorists.

Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew affected the western portion of Mississippi Coast. Sustained winds of 34 knots (39 mph) and a maximum gust of 39 knots (45 mph) was recorded at the NOAA automated weather station at Waveland. The storm surge was generally 2 to 4 feet above normal along portions of the Mississippi coast with the highest storm surge recorded at Waveland at 5.13 ft MLLW. The lowest pressure recorded along the Mississippi coast was was 1005.4 mb at Gulfport on October 10th at 1654 CST.No tornadoes were reported. Storm total rainfall varied from 2 to 4 inches in Hancock and Harrison Counties. Some coastal flooding due to storm surge was reported in Hancock County.

Unusual in that the first round of heavy snow was not directly associated with the passage of a surface cyclone, but rather an area of strong forcing well ahead of the main area of low pressure, the storm nonetheless produced snow totals rivaling and exceeding those of the legendary Blizzard of January 1978 in some areas, crippling much of mainly southern portions of central Indiana, in some cases for several days. Fortunately for those affected, however, blizzard conditions were not produced thanks to winds much weaker than those accompanying the 1978 storm.The snow storm began during the very early morning hours of the 22nd, and continued through the day in south central Indiana.  By that evening heavy snow of 4 to nearly 10 inches had fallen, generally south of Interstate 70.  The greatest totals were in southern Indiana where approximately 10 inches had fallen.There was a sharp cutoff for this heavy snow.  Much of the state north of I-70 did not see any snow.  In the Indianapolis area, the Carmel and Brownsburg areas received no snow while the Greenwood area measured 4 inches.  During the evening of the 22nd, the second band of snow moved in as the surface low passed to the southeast of the state, blanketing all of central and southern Indiana.  Thundersnow was reported in several areas across central Indiana.  Snow of 4 to more than 18 inches fell from this next storm system.  Once again the heaviest snow fell in southern Indiana.  This brought the accumulation in much of southern Indiana to more than 20 inches with some spots reporting more than 30 inches of total snow by the afternoon of the 23rd.  Such snowfall amounts are historic not only in southern Indiana but for the entire state.Snowfall in northwestern portions of central Indiana was heavy at times, approaching 3 to 5 inches in Warren, Tippecanoe, Carroll, Clinton, Fountain, Vermillion, and Parke Counties.This epic snow storm closed I-64, I-65, I-74 and crippled I-70 in Indiana.  This stranded hundreds of motorists in their vehicles for hours and some for a few days.  A train derailment and collision also occurred in southern Indiana as a result of the snow. One hundred National Guardsmen were called out in some areas, especially in those areas where motorists were stranded.  Two blackhawk helicopters and 47 humvees were used in searching for stranded motorists.  Statewide, 200 property damage auto accidents were reported, along with 1,000 slide-offs, according to the Indianapolis Star. Several rescues were necessary.

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer.

Racing west-northwest at 25 mph, Tropical Storm Sarika passed between Pagan and Agrihan that evening between 2100 and 2300 SST with maximum winds of 70 mph, only 5 days after Typhoon Songda dealt a severe blow to those same islands. But by 1000 SST the morning of the 6th, Sarika was already over 200 miles west-northwest of Agrihan and moving quickly away.  Pagan Island:  Tropical Storm Sarika passed 25 miles north-northeast of Pagan at around 2100 SST on September 5th. The automated station on Pagan recorded a maximum sustained wind of 35 mph from the west at 2100 SST, and a peak gust of 58 mph from the west-southwest an hour later at 2200 SST. The lowest sea-level pressure of 1000.4 mb occurred at 2100 SST. In the 12 hours ending at 0300 SST on the 6th, Pagan recorded 3.92 inches of rain. Agrihan:  Sarika passed just 15 miles south-southwest of Agrihan at 2230 SST on September 5th. No wind measurements are available, but island residents estimated winds at 60 to 80 mph. Alamagan:  Sarika passed about 60 miles north-northeast of Alamagan around 2030 SST on the 5th. No wind estimates are available, but it is unlikely that sustained winds reached tropical storm force.  STORM EFFECTS AND DAMAGEAlamagan/Pagan/Agrihan: No deaths or injuries were reported on any of the islands. Housing and crops on the islands had already been severely damaged or destroyed less than a week earlier by Typhoon Songda. As a result, little additional damage was left to be done during Sarika's quick passage.",,"PDS"

As TD 30W moved west-northwest, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nanmadol later that morning at 1000 SST, and passed 60 miles south-southwest of Satawal that afternoon around 1300 SST. After reaching typhoon intensity that evening at 2200 SST, Typhoon Nanmadol passed 85 miles south-southwest of Faraulep at 2330 SST, then moved directly over Woleai early on the morning of November 30th at 0030 SST with maximum sustained winds around 80 mph. Nanmadol continued moving rapidly west-northwest at 25 to 28 mph the rest of that day, passing 55 miles southwest of Fais at 1230 SST, 55 miles southwest of Ulithi at 1600 SST, and just 20 miles northeast of Yap that evening at 1830 SST. By this time, maximum winds near the center were estimated at 90 mph, but Nanmadol's rapid movement kept the strongest winds in the northern semicircle of the typhoon, with much weaker winds south of the center. By 0400 SST the morning of December 1st, Typhoon Nanmadol was already 225 miles west-northwest of Yap, moving quickly away. During its quick traversal of Yap State, Nanmadol brought heavy rain and brief periods of tropical storm conditions to the islands it visited. Satawal/Faraulep:  No observations were available. Winds were likely around 40 mph with gusts to 50 mph around the time of closest approach.Woleai:  Wind measurements at Woleai were sporadic and unrepresentative, but the highest sustained winds were likely 55 to 70 mph between 2300 SST and 0200 SST on the 29th-30th. In the 24 hours ending at 1000 SST on the 30th, 6.05 inches of rain fell. No pressure measurements were available.Fais:  No observations were available, but conditions were likely similar to those on Ulithi. Ulithi:  The highest sustained wind at Ulithi's automated observing station was 47 mph from the east-northeast at 1400 SST on the 30th. The peak gust of 70 mph from the east  occurred between 1400 and 1500 SST. Rainfall was relatively light, amounting to only 1.32 inches between 0000 and 1500 SST on the 30th. The barometer was inoperative. Yap:  The highest sustained wind at the airport was 35 mph; from the northwest at 1750 SST on the 30th, and from the southwest at 1854 SST. The peak gust of 61 mph was from the west at 1806 SST. Rainfall was heavy, amounting to 7.43 inches in the 24 hours ending at 2200 SST on the 30th. The lowest sea-level pressure was 983.9 mb at 1750 SST. STORM EFFECTS AND DAMAGESatawal/Faraulep:  There was little or no structural damage, but some banana and papaya trees were blown down. Breadfruit trees suffered moderate damage, with breadfruit being blown from the trees. Woleai/Fais/Ulithi:  Most of the banana and papaya trees were blown down, and most of the breadfruit trees lost their fruit. Structural damage was minor. Yap:  Little or no structural damage was reported. About 60% of the banana and papaya trees were blown down, and some breadfruit trees lost their fruit. Total damage from Typhoon Nanmadol is estimated at $50,000, nearly all crop damage.",,"PDS"

After giving Kwajalein and the nearby island of Ebeye a brief period of tropical storm conditions, Talas  proceeded west, passing 55 miles south of Ujae at about 0700 SST on the 11th. Tropical Storm Talas then continued on a westerly track over the next two days, passing well south of Guam the evening of the 13th, and well north of Yap the following evening.Kwajalein:  The highest sustained wind was from the east-northeast at 46 mph at 2154 SST on the 10th.
