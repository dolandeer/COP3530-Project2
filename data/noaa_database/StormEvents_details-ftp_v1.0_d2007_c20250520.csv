This event occurred within a large stratiform rain shield associated with a tropical disturbance which was later classified as Tropical Storm Barry in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.","A tornado touched down at 1155 EST June 1st along Mira Road on Sugarloaf Key, downing a 30-foot Ficus tree, damaging a screen porch and scattering loose items stored underneath an elevated home.  The tornado likely had an intermittent north northwest path partially over water, before damging a home on Hawksbill Road along the northeast portion of Sugarloaf Key.  An enclosed patio along the back portion of the home had been destroyed, allowing metal covering to peel back on roughly one third of the home. No other homes were damaged, including one across a canal directly in the path of the tornado. Therefore it was concluded the the roof covering failure without any wood roof decking failures occurred due to the failure of the light wood porch.  Heavy rain was noted which also may have caused excessive loads on the screens, contributing to porch failure.  Therefore the maximum damage rating for the entire event was set at EF0.","CSV"

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint.

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint.

By late on the 8th Georgia State Road 94 and Florida State Road 2 (All one road with two designations) was closed from Moniac, Georgia to Fargo, Georgia due to the threat of the Bugaboo Scrub fire crossing SR 2 and poor visibility because of smoke in the area. By 4:00 p.m. EDT 500 people were evacuated from the vicinity of Taylor, Florida in northern Baker County and others were evacuated near Moniac, Georgia. The focus the fire fighting efforts from May 8th-10th was on structure protection in the Taylor and Baxter, Florida area.  Fire crews, along with private timber companies, were working along the flanks of the fire where conditions allowed, as well as, working to protect structures.

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint. Significant water conservation measures were being implemented in many cities across north and central Georgia.||Note, the impact of the drought on crops and the estimated monetary damage was included with the September 2007 Storm Data.  Additional crop losses from September to October should be minimal in comparison as October marks the end of the growing season.","","CSV"

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint. Significant water conservation measures were being implemented in many cities across north and central Georgia.||Note, the impact of the drought on crops and the estimated monetary damage was included with the September 2007 Storm Data.  Additional crop losses from September to October should be minimal in comparison as October marks the end of the growing season.","","CSV"

Strong surface instability, and gust fronts that developed from these storms, focused new shower and thunderstorm development, with several of these storms becoming severe. One longer lived severe thunderstorm developed over eastern Upshur County, then merged with another southward moving band of strong thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage across eastern Upshur, much of Gregg, and northern Rusk County. The cities of Longview and Kilgore were hit hardest, with numerous trees blown down/uprooted, power lines downed, and trees falling onto homes, with at least one known injury reported.

D3 (extreme) drought conditions lasted around Lake Okeechobee until June 12th, with D2 (severe) drought conditions the remainder of the month. D2 drought conditions remained across Broward County until June 5th, eastern Palm Beach County until June 12th, and Collier County until June 19th when more consistent summer rains became more established across the area.||The level of Lake Okeechobee remained fairly steady, recovering only slightly from its low of 8.94 at the beginning of the month to 8.9 feet by June 29th. This slow change in the lake level resulted in a continuation of significant drought impacts for the general public, with water usage restrictions continuing across South Florida. Phase 3 restrictions (50 percent reduction in usage) were in place for Broward County and the Lake Okeechobee area, while the rest of South Florida was under Phase 2 restrictions (30 percent reduction). Wells across interior and western sections of South Florida were running at below 10 percent of normal, and underground reservoirs were also running below normal area-wide.||The extremely dry conditions along with gradually increasing  thunderstorm activity resulted in several new wildfires breaking out interior sections of South Florida. In addition, large wildfires which started in May at the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and the Paterson Fire in Hendry County continued to burn into the first half of June. Over 65,000 acres were consumed between those two fires alone.","CSV"

Many vehicles were reported in the ditch, especially along Interstate 94 between Moorhead and Fergus Falls. 10 inches of snow was reported at Norcross, 9 inches near Battle Lake, and 7 inches at Ponsford, Wadena, and Wendell.","","CSV"

Damage was observed at the Three Rivers Muncipal Airport and at an adjacent residence to the airport. A hangar door was blown open at the airport, with 2 large tree trunks falling onto parked vehicles at a private residence. One of the vehicles had pulled into the driveway due to poor visbility, and before the driver could exit, the tree trunk fell onto the roof of the car, causing minor head injury to the driver. The Three Rivers AWOS (KHAI) recorded a 68 mph wind gust at 548 pm EDT. As the survey progressed along M-60 to some of the back roads, more extensive damage began to be encountered. A barn was found destroyed by a combination of the strong winds and a small shed being picked up and thrown into the barn. An adjacent barn also suffered moderate damage from the wind. Numerous trees limbs were snapped in the yard, as well as the chimney of the 2 story residence being blown over to roof level. Just to the north of this residence a large grove of various hardwood trees suffered extensive damage with many trees being uprooted or snapped. The sandy soil in the area reduced the resistance of the roots somewhat.  A residence as well as a barn suffered only minor damage despite the estimated 90 to 95 mph winds. KIWX 88D Base velocity data showed a couplet with 82 kt (94 mph) outbound winds in this general area. Damage continued northeast towards Mendon where trees continued to be damaged as well as 2 barns. |With the strength of the winds, it is possible that a few gust front tornadoes (gustnadoes) may have developed and helped locally focus some of the damage, but by far the strength of the straight line winds was more significant then the potential winds of any gustnadoes.","CSV"

D3 (extreme) drought conditions lasted around Lake Okeechobee until June 12th, with D2 (severe) drought conditions the remainder of the month. D2 drought conditions remained across Broward County until June 5th, eastern Palm Beach County until June 12th, and Collier County until June 19th when more consistent summer rains became more established across the area.||The level of Lake Okeechobee remained fairly steady, recovering only slightly from its low of 8.94 at the beginning of the month to 8.9 feet by June 29th. This slow change in the lake level resulted in a continuation of significant drought impacts for the general public, with water usage restrictions continuing across South Florida. Phase 3 restrictions (50 percent reduction in usage) were in place for Broward County and the Lake Okeechobee area, while the rest of South Florida was under Phase 2 restrictions (30 percent reduction). Wells across interior and western sections of South Florida were running at below 10 percent of normal, and underground reservoirs were also running below normal area-wide.||The extremely dry conditions along with gradually increasing  thunderstorm activity resulted in several new wildfires breaking out interior sections of South Florida.

At one farmstead, the twister killed nearly a dozen head of cattle. The tornado damaged or destroyed many outbuildings and farmhouses. The storm survey team rated this tornado as an EF2 based on damage to a farmhouse (FR12) that lost half of its roof and had many windows blown out (DOD6). This would have had an expected wind speed around 114 mph. Many wood utility poles (ETL) were also broken off at their base or snapped in half (DOD4).

It crossed Interstate 80 where several vehicles and semis were blown off the road with several injuries reported, thankfully, none serious. At one farmstead, the twister killed nearly a dozen head of cattle. The tornado damaged or destroyed many outbuildings and farmhouses. The storm survey team rated this tornado as an EF2 based on damage to a farmhouse (FR12) that lost half of its roof and had many windows blown out (DOD6). This would have had an expected wind speed around 114 mph. Many wood utility poles (ETL) were also broken off at their base or snapped in half (DOD4). This would have an expected wind speed of 120 mph. The tornado had a maximum width around 3/4 mile about 5 miles north of Gothenburg.

The cold front was strong for early June, with a noon temperature in Devils Lake, ND, of 48 degrees. This set up a strong surface thermal and moisture boundary along a Wahpeton-Breckenridge to Bemidji line.

Strong surface instability, and gust fronts that developed from these storms, focused new shower and thunderstorm development, with several of these storms becoming severe. One longer lived severe thunderstorm developed over eastern Upshur County, then merged with another southward moving band of strong thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage across eastern Upshur, much of Gregg, and northern Rusk County. The cities of Longview and Kilgore were hit hardest, with numerous trees blown down/uprooted, power lines downed, and trees falling onto homes, with at least one known injury reported.

As of May 29th, all of South Florida north of a West Palm Beach to Naples line was under D3 (extreme) drought status, with areas south of that line in a D2 (severe) drought status, with the exception of Miami-Dade County which was not considered to be in a drought.||Rainfall had begun to fall a little more regularly by the end of the month across eastern sections, but remained sporadic all month across interior and western areas.||The level of Lake Okeechobee continued to lower, and reached a all-time record low of 8.94 feet by May 31st. Significant impacts continued for the general public as water usage restrictions continued across South Florida. Phase 3 restrictions (50 percent reduction in usage) were in effect while the rest of South Florida was under Phase 2 restrictions (30 percent reduction). Wells across most of South Florida were running at below 10 percent of normal, and underground reservoirs were also running below normal area-wide.||The extremely dry conditions along with scattered thunderstorms early in the month resulted in several wildfires breaking out across South Florida as a result of lighning. One wildfire burned in the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County for over a month from a lightning strike on May 4th, with over 60,000 acres burned. Another wildfire in the Picayune Strand State Forest started from lightning on May 7th, burning over 18,000 acres. On May 8th, the fire damaged 3 homes in the Golden Gate Estates area and threatened 33 others.

The remnants of Hurricane Humberto then tracked across central Louisiana, central Mississippi, and into northern Alabama on the 14th.  The center of the remnant of the track moved across extreme northwest Georgia, Dade and Walker county, on the 14th.

By the time the month ended, most river locations exceeded flood levels at least once during the 31 day period.  ||During the first part of July, a persistent, nearly stationary upper level low which brought catastrophic flooding to North Texas late in June moved south during the first few days in July, resulting in very heavy rainfall and widespread flooding over much of the area. Dozens of flash flood warnings were issued, and moderate to major flooding was observed over most rivers east of the Rio Grande. In fact, some of the river crests observed were comparable to those observed during July 2002 and September 2002, when record flooding was observed over the Nueces River basin. Six locations had crests which were within the top five highest crests ever recorded:||	Nueces River at Calallen (4th highest)|	Nueces River at Bluntzer (3rd highest)|	Aransas River at Skidmore (3rd highest)|	Garcitas Creek near Inez (3rd highest)|	Oso Creek near Corpus Christi (5th highest)|	Copano Creek near Refugio (3rd highest)||The reservoirs for the Corpus Christi water supply quickly filled, and required releases brought major flooding to the Nueces River south of Lake Corpus Christi.  In fact, Bluntzer and Calallen remained above flood stage through July (in part due to rainfall received later in the month). ||The Corpus Christi International Airport had the second highest monthly rainfall amount, totaling 18.13 inches (the highest was September 1967 with the remnants of Hurricane Beulah). The Victoria Regional Airport received 20.34 inches. Obviously, all of this excessive rainfall completely filled the reservoirs, with both Choke Canyon and Lake Corpus Christi continuing to release water through July 31.","Both the Nueces River at Calallen and the Nueces River at Bluntzer recorded major flooding in July.  Several homes were flooded forcing evacuations.  Disaster declarations were declared for both San Patricio and Nueces counties due to this river flooding.  Dollar estimates on the damage were not known at the time of this writing.  Flooding of the Nueces River in this area began on June 29th and continued through August 25th.","CSV"
