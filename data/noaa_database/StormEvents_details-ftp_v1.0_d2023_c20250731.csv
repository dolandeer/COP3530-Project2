D4 (Exceptional Drought) conditions expanded farther across central and southwestern portions of the state including most areas encompassed by a loop from Vicksburg to Kosciusko to Philadelphia to Columbia. Average temperatures for the month especially in the most impacted areas ranged from 2 to 4 degrees F above normal, and several daily temperature records were set. Observed precipitation values across a vast majority of the state were less than 25 percent of normal. In southeastern Mississippi where around 2 to 3 inches of rain fell during the month - about 70 percent of normal - average temperatures were about 1 degree below normal. Soil moisture values continued to worsen through the month, with subsoil moisture values between 25 to 50 percent below normal for much of the affected area. This placed a severe stress on pastures for livestock and reduced the yield from row crops to end the growing season.

A warm front lifted to near the Mountain Parkway during the morning hours, ushering in a muggy airmass for those locations to the south of the Parkway. Sun shining on this juicy air mass helped build up moderate amounts of instability south of the warm front as temperatures warmed into the upper 70s to mid 80s there. Meanwhile, persistent cloud cover and a weak northeasterly breeze north of the front kept temperatures cooler and conditions much more stable. A wave of low pressure rode along the stalled warm front during this afternoon, triggering supercell storms in the area between the warm front and the Hal Rogers Parkway/KY-80 corridor. These storms dropped severe to significant-sized hail. One of the supercells also produced a brief tornado in Magoffin County southwest of Salyersville. Further south, weaker shear led to less organized storm structures, but even there the storms still generated strong outflows leading to bowing storm lines and damaging wind gusts.","County dispatch reported power line blown down on Bourne Avenue close to the intersection of Murphy Avenue.","CSV"

Ahead of this line, a few supercells also spawned tornadoes in portions of central and eastern Georgia.  Upon further examination of radar data and high resolution areal imagery, it was found that several tornadoes rotated around and within a larger vortex and caused the widespread damage in the area near Griffin GA, over 2 miles wide in some cases.  |The result was that as many as 4 tornadoes were on the ground simultaneously in SW Spalding County, which were rotating around the larger circulation, merging together in several cases and crossing paths. The presence of 3 mergers was identified in the reanalysis. Additional analysis revealed that wind speeds in the EF3 storm reached|as high as 155mph or high end EF3.  This confirmed a total of 14 tornadoes, including 10 which resulted from the same storm/larger mesocyclone.","This long-track tornado originated in Chambers County, Alabama. The entire survey was conducted by NWS Birmingham. Estimated start point was near County Road 114 west of Highway 431 to the southwest of Five Points. Northeast of Five Points, the tornado intensified, snapping and uprooting many trees along County Road 267 and causing roof damage to a barn. The swath of timber damage became almost a mile wide along County Roads 281 and 282 and at least one residence there suffered roof damage. The tornado continued to intensify as it crossed County Road 268 where large swaths of pine trees were snapped. A manufactured home was completely destroyed and blown downstream near County Road 278. Most of the structural damage happened along County Road 284. A couple residences suffered significant shingle damage, one had siding damage, and a manufactured home had its porch ripped off, impacting its walls. Another manufactured building was blown off its footings. Another significant swath of snapped pines was observed on County Road 283, some snapped off only a couple feet off the ground. The tornado then crossed into Georgia, continuing to snap trees along West Point Lake. Numerous trees were snapped along the end of North State Line Rd.as the tornado crossed the lake. The tornado began to weaken some as it made its way into Deer Point Rd and Rock Mills Road where tree damage and some damage to shingles and gutters occurred for a few homes. The tornado continued east through mostly wooded areas, doing damage to pines and crossing just north of a few homes along Neely Rd. Weakening continued as it continued NE with only minor tree damage occurring before the tornado dissipated along Cameron Mill Rd.","CSV"

Ahead of this line, a few supercells also spawned tornadoes in portions of central and eastern Georgia.  Upon further examination of radar data and high resolution areal imagery, it was found that several tornadoes rotated around and within a larger vortex and caused the widespread damage in the area near Griffin GA, over 2 miles wide in some cases.  |The result was that as many as 4 tornadoes were on the ground simultaneously in SW Spalding County, which were rotating around the larger circulation, merging together in several cases and crossing paths. The presence of 3 mergers was identified in the reanalysis. Additional analysis revealed that wind speeds in the EF3 storm reached|as high as 155mph or high end EF3.  This confirmed a total of 14 tornadoes, including 10 which resulted from the same storm/larger mesocyclone.","New high resolution areal imagery in concert with a reanalysis of radar data, areal surveys and ground surveys it has been determined that there were multiple tornadoes on the ground simultaneously in southwest Spalding and Northwestern Pike Counties as well as crossing tornado paths. The tornadoes were part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado. Our analysis determined that this tornado spun up near the center of the main mesocylone as it crossed the Flint River in SW Spalding County. The first evidence of a tornado touching down appear along Blanton Mill Road where several trees were uprooted. This tornado would become caught within the larger circulation and swing SE around the center through mostly wooded or swampy areas of SW Spalding County. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted in a path that that tracks ESE until it reaches Scott Barch Road. It is in this area it crosses the path of a tornado which passes approximately 2 minutes early moving NE on the eastern periphery of the larger mesocyclone. Low end EF1 damage occurred to a barn in this area, however, it could have occurred with the first tornado. Numerous trees are uprooted or snapped in this area as well. The tornado continued ESE crossing Flat Creek causing mid range EF1 damage to trees. It is noted per areal imagery and radar data that as the tornado approached Yarborough Rd and Shackleford Road it become absorbed/merged with a larger stronger circulation/tornado moving to the NE. Damage on the ground in this area is indicative of tornadoes coming in from 2 different directions. The particular circulation is terminated at this point as the larger more dominate tornado continues NE toward a rock quarry along Rover Zetalla Road. It should also be noted that EF2 damage occurred shortly after these 2 tornadoes merged near Yarborough Road but will be attributed to the more dominate circulation.","CSV"

This resulted in numerous ice jams and snowmelt flooding on the Yukon River. Breakup flooding began on May 12th in eastern Alaska in Eagle and ended on June 3rd in the Yukon River delta at the Bering Sea coast. The primary cause of this active flood year was a 1-2 week delay in breakup when compared to typical timing. April temperatures were well below normal, and when temperatures began to warm in early May, it melted the low-elevation snowpack quickly. Because of the relatively quick addition of snowmelt onto strong ice, the ice was more susceptible to jamming and floods. In addition to the late breakup, the snowpack this winter was 1 to 1.5 times greater than the climatological normal for interior and western Alaska. Significant ice jams and associated flooding on the Upper Yukon River resulted in large volumes of ice and water to move down into the Middle Yukon River.","An ice jam on the Yukon River approx 100 miles downriver from Tanana caused minor flooding in the community.","CSV"

While a lack of instability north of a surface warm front limited the threat of severe weather, precipitable water values on the order of 1.2-1.4 inches and lifting above the low-level front promoted the development of widespread moderate to occasionally heavy rainfall. Ultimately, widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches were observed across southern Indiana, with locally higher totals as high as 5 inches also observed.

Low-level reflection of mid-level amplification manifested as a 50 knot low-level jet helped higher moisture air surge northward into southern Indiana during the late evening hours on March 24th. While a lack of instability north of a surface warm front limited the threat of severe weather, precipitable water values on the order of 1.2-1.4 inches and lifting above the low-level front promoted the development of widespread moderate to occasionally heavy rainfall. Ultimately, widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches were observed across southern Indiana, with locally higher totals as high as 5 inches also observed. This resulted in isolated instances of flooding, while the modest precipitation rates likely limited more widespread flash flooding issues.","A video showed several inches of water flowing across a roadway in Depauw.","CSV"

The tornado moved rapidly to the east where it made a direct impact on a home. At this location, the home roof was removed, windows broken, siding ruined, numerous trees snapped, a shed was demolished, and numerous items were thrown up to a half mile downstream. The convergent damage pattern at this location, eyewitness reports of wind direction, along with the 80-yard-wide path of more intense damage gives great confidence that this was a tornado. Winds at this location were estimated at 120 mph based on damage. The tornado moved quickly southeast, causing substantial tree damage with snapped trunks being common along the continued 50 to 100 yard wide track. The tornado moved through neighborhood of acreages along Quentin trail where it snapped many trees but moved in between the homes. The track then became more intermittent for a couple miles before it partially removed the roof of a home along 296th Street and caused additional narrow tree damage for the next two miles. The final damage point that was pretty clearly tornado damage was near 305th and Upton where 3 grain bins were crumpled and blown downstream and a machine shed sustained substantial damage. Beyond this point, the tree damage was sporadic and more evident of the larger scale wind field. Should also note that to the west of this tornado track, there was a debris signature evident on radar, but the damage was much more consistent with a focused downburst or series of downbursts that moved up from the Missouri Valley into the Loess Hills and may have helped to loft light leafy debris. This downburst likely led to the development of the eventual tornado.","CSV"

There it dropped numerous trees onto the NJ Transit Line and snapped the trunk|of around ten trees. As it moved to the northeast, the storm uprooted two maple trees along Mine Brook behind the Rose Bowl Baseball field that were on a slight embankment. The storm continued to move towards the northeast into Bernardsville|where it produced tree damage along Laurel Lane and snapped the trunk of a tree that appeared not to be fully healthy. The tornado then started to move more towards the north following Mine Brook through Bernardsville producing damage from Timber|Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd where it snapped the trunk of a pine tree that ended up falling on a vehicle. The peak width of the tornado was over this area where the damage path was approximately Four hundred seventy five yards between the damage from Timber Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd. Additional damage was found along the path of Anderson Hill Rd moving to the north towards the intersection of Seney Dr and Anderson Hill Rd where numerous trees were brought down with at least two ending up on power lines. At the intersection of Anderson Hill Rd and Rolling Hill Rd, another|large tree had its trunk snapped. However, the interior of the tree was determined not to be healthy, so the expected winds based on the DoD were reduced significantly. As the storm was starting to occlude and weaken, it took down several more trees along|Old Fort Road including uprooting multiple trees with wide, but shallow root systems. The tornado then dissipated as the storm moved further to the northeast. The EF-1 rating is primarily based on the number of trees with snapped trunks with the highest|concentration in a single location being along the NJ transit line. This is where the damage indicator of hardwood trees with degree of damage of trunks snapped produced an expected wind speed of one hundred five mph.","CSV"

The heavier rainfall across those contributed to a major rockfall and subsequently lead to an extended road closure on SR-208 in Wilson Canyon (Figure 4). Reports of areal flooding included I-80 near Lockwood, NN, Geiger Grade at Toll Rd in the Virginia City highlands, and along US-395 south of Reno with flooding from Steamboat Creek spilling over Towne Road. The changeover to snow in western Nevada arrived during the morning commute on January 10th which led to several related traffic incidents that included a 19-car pile-up on the Galena Bridge on I-580.","The public at the Mount Rose Ski Base and Diamond Peak Ski Base reported 24 hour snowfall totals of 12 and 22 inches respectively, as well as 3 day storm total snowfall amounts  of  56 and 31 inches respectively.","CSV"

This left eastern Nebraska in the warm sector as a warm front moved north into the area. The SPC issued an Enhanced Risk for severe weather with a 30% hatched for severe hail. There ended up being 19 confirmed tornadoes (3 EF2, 8 EF1, 4 EF0, 4 EFU). There were numerous hail reports the largest of which was 4.5 inches in Pawnee County. Another 4-inch report was received in Richardson County. Flash flooding was also observed in a few locations.","This is part 1 of the tornado, Part 2  continues into Burt County. The tornado touched down just south of Highway 275, damaging a home, power poles and numerous trees as it entered the Elkhorn River valley. it caused EF-2 damage to a home just south of the Elkhorn River where a porch was ripped off and large trees damaged. The tornado crossed the Elkhorn River where significant tree damage was noted and several center pivots were flipped over. The tornado became wider and impacted additional farmsteads with EF-2 damage, especially as it approached County Road F up to the Dodge and Burt county line. At these farmsteads, several hog barns, machine sheds, and well-built outbuildings were destroyed. Farm equipment was significantly damaged. Windows were broken out of homes, roofs damaged, porches ripped off, and garage doors sucked out. Several people noted that their ears still hurt a day later due to the pressure drop during the tornado. Numerous livestock were injured or killed. The maximum width of this tornado approached one mile as it moved between County Road F and County Road B. A large cattle feedlot was impacted in extreme northeast Dodge county where very large grain bins and well built barns were destroyed. This tornado exhibited multiple vortex damage patterns at times.
