Very cold air surged into northern Ohio in response to this high and was accompanied by strong north to northwest winds.  The combination of sub zero temperatures and winds gusting to as much as 30 mph created very dangerous wind chills over most of northern Ohio.  Wind chill readings dipped below minus 25 degrees during the predawn hours of 15th and then continued for four to six hours.  By midday, wind chills were back into the negative teens with slow improvement the remainder of the day.  Winds finally lessened during the evening hours as the high approached from the northwest.  By daybreak on the 16th, the high was centered over the Upper Ohio Valley resulting in clear skies and another frigid night.  Lows on the 15th were mainly 5 to 10 degrees below zero but most of the area dipped below minus 10 on the 16th.  The coldest wind chill reported was minus 30 at Toledo Express Airport (Lucas County) with minus 29 at the Northeast Ohio Regional Airport in Ashtabula County.  Fortunately all of the schools in northern Ohio were closed on the 16th for the Presidents Day Holiday.","Sub zero temperatures and winds gusting to as much as 30 mph caused winds chills to get as cold as minus 30 degrees during the morning of February 15th.

At the National Weather Service Office in central Guam 9.64 inches fell on the 15th with an additional 3.94 inches on the 16th. 13.58 inches in total. The wind and rainfall caused sporadic power outages across Guam. The heavy rainfall produced high stream flow in the Ugum River in Guam. This high stream flow increases the turbidity of the water, which hampers the Ugum Water Treatment Plant and its processing of drinking water. The plant had to shut down, which caused|water outages in parts of Guam.|The heavy rain produced flooding which temporarily caused a shutdown of a power sub-station in Tumon creating a power outage there. ||The heavy rainfall caused Guam bound flights to be diverted to Saipan. One Delta Airline flight was also canceled. Three flights were also stuck in Saipan, China Eastern, United Star Alliance, and Jin Air all had passengers disembark from the respective flights.  Three United Airline flights were diverted to Andersen Air Force Base. The flights came from Honolulu, Manila, and Palau.","CSV"

Most locations saw around a half inch to an inch of sleet, along with around a tenth of an inch of ice accretion. The valleys of southwest North Carolina saw more freezing rain than sleet, with about one quarter inch of ice reported. Scattered power outages were therefore more concentrated there.

Meanwhile, the northern foothills saw mostly sleet, with many areas reporting 2 to 3 inches of accumulation. Roads became very treacherous and impassable in many areas until melting began on the afternoon of the 17th.","","CSV"

By daybreak on the 19th, while the gusty winds continued, air temperatures ranged from 5 below to 5 above in the valleys, and as low as -20 on the high peaks and ridge tops of the northern mountains. Wind chill values during this time ranged from -15 to -20 in the valleys, while the high elevations likely saw values as low as -50, if not lower. The dangerous wind chills continued throughout the 19th, as air temperatures failed to warm above the teens in even the lowest valleys and the high elevations remained below 0, while most areas remained in the single digits.

After sunrise, the precipitation became light in intensity and fell mainly as freezing rain through much of the day on Tuesday, December 29th. The precipitation gradually ended by the evening hours as temperatures finally warmed above freezing by late in the day. ||Most areas saw 2 to 4 inches of snow and sleet with a light glaze of ice on top. As a result of the wintry precipitation, slippery travel resulted in many car accidents throughout the region, especially during the morning commute on Tuesday, December 29th.

As it received the full effect of the still wide open and relatively warm waters of Lake Erie, it stalled and intensified for a few hours before continuing further north and weakening later in the afternoon.  During this time, visibilities dropped to zero along with wind gusts to 45 mph.  This created brief blizzard-like conditions while dropping a quick 2-4 inches of snow.  Luckily, this occurred between commuting times, and by the evening the band had dramatically weakened over primarily Niagara County. Following the passage of a surface trough a heavy band developed over the Niagara Peninsula around 2am, quickly moving across Niagara County, and then over the Buffalo Metro area for the remainder of the night. This portion of the event produced snow rates near 3 inches per hour during the morning commute. A portion of the New York State Thruway was closed. During Friday morning, the band moved quickly south and lost its connection to Lake Erie for several hours until a new band started to form around noon over the Western Southern Tier.  This band grew stronger throughout the day, and by the evening snow rates of three to four inches per hour were once again reported in a 15-20 mile wide swatch, this time primarily along and south of Route 20A, affecting the Southtowns and ski country.  Many area roadways remained closed. By Saturday morning, some areas in the Southtowns had received as much as 20 inches of snow, most of it occurring in about a 6 hour period.   During Saturday, the band quickly weakened as it headed quickly to the north where if finally fell completely apart by nightfall.  Specific snowfall reported included:  23 inches at Attica, 21 inches at Wyoming and Perrysburg, 20 inches at East Aurora and Boston, 19 inches at Hamburg, 13 inches at Buffalo International Airport, 12 inches at North Tonawanda, and 8 inches at Corfu and Medina.","","CSV"

Luckily, this occurred between commuting times, and by the evening the band had dramatically weakened over primarily Niagara County.

As it received the full effect of the still wide open and relatively warm waters of Lake Erie, it stalled and intensified for a few hours before continuing further north and weakening later in the afternoon.  During this time, visibilities dropped to zero along with wind gusts to 45 mph.  This created brief blizzard-like conditions while dropping a quick 2-4 inches of snow.  Luckily, this occurred between commuting times, and by the evening the band had dramatically weakened over primarily Niagara County. Following the passage of a surface trough a heavy band developed over the Niagara Peninsula around 2am, quickly moving across Niagara County, and then over the Buffalo Metro area for the remainder of the night. This portion of the event produced snow rates near 3 inches per hour during the morning commute. A portion of the New York State Thruway was closed. During Friday morning, the band moved quickly south and lost its connection to Lake Erie for several hours until a new band started to form around noon over the Western Southern Tier.  This band grew stronger throughout the day, and by the evening snow rates of three to four inches per hour were once again reported in a 15-20 mile wide swatch, this time primarily along and south of Route 20A, affecting the Southtowns and ski country.  Many area roadways remained closed. By Saturday morning, some areas in the Southtowns had received as much as 20 inches of snow, most of it occurring in about a 6 hour period.   During Saturday, the band quickly weakened as it headed quickly to the north where if finally fell completely apart by nightfall.

The moisture received during the month helped to sustain the season's winter wheat crop and improve rangeland conditions in a few areas.  Cattle herd sizes remained limited due to prolonged drought and high cattle prices.  Upper soil zones were mostly in the 10 to 30 percent full range (moderate agriculturally dry), with locations in the eastern Panhandle generally drier.  Deeper soil moisture was still below 70 percent of normal in much of the Oklahoma Panhandle, especially the eastern half.  The Palmer Drought Severity Index indicated a rating of Near Normal conditions for the Oklahoma Panhandle.  No countywide or statewide burn bans were in effect.||Streamflows and reservoir levels across the Oklahoma Panhandle were below normal to much below normal during January.||Economic losses due to the drought through January were predominantly the result of early losses in some late-planted winter wheat and supplemental feed for cattle on drought-thinned rangeland and pastures.","Severe Drought (D2) as depicted on the U.S. Drought Monitor.","CSV"

As it received the full effect of the still wide open and relatively warm waters of Lake Erie, it stalled and intensified for a few hours before continuing further north and weakening later in the afternoon.  During this time, visibilities dropped to zero along with wind gusts to 45 mph.  This created brief blizzard-like conditions while dropping a quick 2-4 inches of snow.  Luckily, this occurred between commuting times, and by the evening the band had dramatically weakened over primarily Niagara County. Following the passage of a surface trough a heavy band developed over the Niagara Peninsula around 2am, quickly moving across Niagara County, and then over the Buffalo Metro area for the remainder of the night. This portion of the event produced snow rates near 3 inches per hour during the morning commute. A portion of the New York State Thruway was closed. During Friday morning, the band moved quickly south and lost its connection to Lake Erie for several hours until a new band started to form around noon over the Western Southern Tier.  This band grew stronger throughout the day, and by the evening snow rates of three to four inches per hour were once again reported in a 15-20 mile wide swatch, this time primarily along and south of Route 20A, affecting the Southtowns and ski country.  Many area roadways remained closed. By Saturday morning, some areas in the Southtowns had received as much as 20 inches of snow, most of it occurring in about a 6 hour period.   During Saturday, the band quickly weakened as it headed quickly to the north where if finally fell completely apart by nightfall.  Specific snowfall reported included:  23 inches at Attica, 21 inches at Wyoming and Perrysburg, 20 inches at East Aurora and Boston, 19 inches at Hamburg, 13 inches at Buffalo International Airport, 12 inches at North Tonawanda, and 8 inches at Corfu and Medina.","","CSV"

During this time, visibilities dropped to zero along with wind gusts to 45 mph.  This created brief blizzard-like conditions while dropping a quick 2-4 inches of snow.  Luckily, this occurred between commuting times, and by the evening the band had dramatically weakened over primarily Niagara County. Following the passage of a surface trough a heavy band developed over the Niagara Peninsula around 2am, quickly moving across Niagara County, and then over the Buffalo Metro area for the remainder of the night. This portion of the event produced snow rates near 3 inches per hour during the morning commute. A portion of the New York State Thruway was closed. During Friday morning, the band moved quickly south and lost its connection to Lake Erie for several hours until a new band started to form around noon over the Western Southern Tier.  This band grew stronger throughout the day, and by the evening snow rates of three to four inches per hour were once again reported in a 15-20 mile wide swatch, this time primarily along and south of Route 20A, affecting the Southtowns and ski country.

The low wind chills continued throughout the 19th, as air temperatures failed to warm above the mid-20s in even the lowest valleys, and the high elevations remained within a few degrees either side of 0. Wind chills remained no higher than the single digits across most of the area until late morning on the 20th.","","CSV"

As it received the full effect of the still wide open and relatively warm waters of Lake Erie, it stalled and intensified for a few hours before continuing further north and weakening later in the afternoon.  During this time, visibilities dropped to zero along with wind gusts to 45 mph.  This created brief blizzard-like conditions while dropping a quick 2-4 inches of snow.  Luckily, this occurred between commuting times, and by the evening the band had dramatically weakened over primarily Niagara County. Following the passage of a surface trough a heavy band developed over the Niagara Peninsula around 2am, quickly moving across Niagara County, and then over the Buffalo Metro area for the remainder of the night. This portion of the event produced snow rates near 3 inches per hour during the morning commute. A portion of the New York State Thruway was closed. During Friday morning, the band moved quickly south and lost its connection to Lake Erie for several hours until a new band started to form around noon over the Western Southern Tier.  This band grew stronger throughout the day, and by the evening snow rates of three to four inches per hour were once again reported in a 15-20 mile wide swatch, this time primarily along and south of Route 20A, affecting the Southtowns and ski country.  Many area roadways remained closed. By Saturday morning, some areas in the Southtowns had received as much as 20 inches of snow, most of it occurring in about a 6 hour period.   During Saturday, the band quickly weakened as it headed quickly to the north where if finally fell completely apart by nightfall.  Specific snowfall reported included:  23 inches at Attica, 21 inches at Wyoming and Perrysburg, 20 inches at East Aurora and Boston, 19 inches at Hamburg, 13 inches at Buffalo International Airport, 12 inches at North Tonawanda, and 8 inches at Corfu and Medina.","","CSV"
