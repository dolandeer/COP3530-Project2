As the surface front moved through Iowa, it stalled out and effectively divided the state in half as it oriented it self from southwest to northeast across the state. While the itself stalled, it separated two distinctly different air masses with temperatures in the 50s to low 70s prevailing on the north side and 80s to around 90 prevailing to the south. Surface moisture was also divided with dew points in the 50s on the cool side and low to mid 70s on the warm side. ||Showers and storms persisted north of the front overnight of the 30th into the 1st and during much of the day of the 1st. That activity yielded little more than periods of moderate to heavy rain and sub-severe thunderstorms. Along and south of the front, thermodynamic and kinematics yielded much more vigorous storms and ultimately heavy rainfall and severe weather. SBCAPE profiles yielded 2000 to 3000+ J/kg by early to mid afternoon along with effective bulk shear around 50 to 60 kts, and persistent strong moisture flow yielding precipitable water values around 1.75 to 2.0 inches. Additionally, in the lowest 1 to 3 km, CAPE values exceed 100 J/kg and was accompanied by enhanced low level helicity due to frontal proximity. As a result, virtually all modes of severe weather were possible. In the end, the majority of reports revolved around severe hail, nearing 3 inches in diameter, and heavy rainfall in excess of 3 to 4 inches.

As a result, warm, moist, and unstable air began to build north along and south of the front, as steepening lapse rates aloft spread east along the axis of increasing large scale forcing ahead of the low. This resulted in an increase in scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms near and south of the warm front from the late evening hours of the 24th through the early morning hours of the 25th across East Texas and North Louisiana. Coupled with the strong wind shear present across the expanding warm sector, several supercell thunderstorms developed, with one supercell spawning six separate tornadoes from San Augustine Texas northeast to Eastern Union Parish Louisiana, directly impacting the cities of San Augustine Texas and Ruston Louisiana along its 150+ mile track across the NWS Shreveport County Warning Area. In fact, this supercell spawned another tornado across Northwest Morehouse and Southern Ashley County Arkansas, to complete its nearly 180 mile track before dissipating. Other isolated supercells developed near and south of the warm front which spawned tornadoes across Northern Caddo Parish and Central La Salle Parish in Northern Louisiana, with other severe thunderstorms producing damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana as well, before the storms exited the region around daybreak on the 25th.","This is a continuation of the Northwest Sabine Parish tornado. This EF-1 tornado began to weaken as it entered Southeast Desoto Parish, with maximum estimated winds around 95 mph. It snapped and uprooted several trees near the Pelican community, where a tree fell on a vehicle on Highway 175 just south of the Highway 483 intersection, resulting in an injury to the female driver in the vehicle. The tornado continued its northeast movement to Highway 177 north of Parish Road 507 snapping and uprooting several more trees before finally lifting. In all, this long track tornado from Eastern Shelby County Texas through Northwest Sabine and Southeast Desoto Parishes in Northwest Louisiana remained on the ground for 32.1 miles before finally lifting.","CSV"

As a result, warm, moist, and unstable air began to build north along and south of the front, as steepening lapse rates aloft spread east along the axis of increasing large scale forcing ahead of the low. This resulted in an increase in scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms near and south of the warm front from the late evening hours of the 24th through the early morning hours of the 25th across East Texas and North Louisiana. Coupled with the strong wind shear present across the expanding warm sector, several supercell thunderstorms developed, with one supercell spawning six separate tornadoes from San Augustine Texas northeast to Eastern Union Parish Louisiana, directly impacting the cities of San Augustine Texas and Ruston Louisiana along its 150+ mile track across the NWS Shreveport County Warning Area. In fact, this supercell spawned another tornado across Northwest Morehouse and Southern Ashley County Arkansas, to complete its nearly 180 mile track before dissipating. Other isolated supercells developed near and south of the warm front which spawned tornadoes across Northern Caddo Parish and Central La Salle Parish in Northern Louisiana, with other severe thunderstorms producing damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana as well, before the storms exited the region around daybreak on the 25th.","Trees were downed along the 4300 block of Highway 485 north of Robeline.","CSV"

As a result, warm, moist, and unstable air began to build north along and south of the front, as steepening lapse rates aloft spread east along the axis of increasing large scale forcing ahead of the low. This resulted in an increase in scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms near and south of the warm front from the late evening hours of the 24th through the early morning hours of the 25th across East Texas and North Louisiana. Coupled with the strong wind shear present across the expanding warm sector, several supercell thunderstorms developed, with one supercell spawning six separate tornadoes from San Augustine Texas northeast to Eastern Union Parish Louisiana, directly impacting the cities of San Augustine Texas and Ruston Louisiana along its 150+ mile track across the NWS Shreveport County Warning Area. In fact, this supercell spawned another tornado across Northwest Morehouse and Southern Ashley County Arkansas, to complete its nearly 180 mile track before dissipating. Other isolated supercells developed near and south of the warm front which spawned tornadoes across Northern Caddo Parish and Central La Salle Parish in Northern Louisiana, with other severe thunderstorms producing damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana as well, before the storms exited the region around daybreak on the 25th.","Numerous trees were blown down in the White Sulphur Springs community.","CSV"

As a result, warm, moist, and unstable air began to build north along and south of the front, as steepening lapse rates aloft spread east along the axis of increasing large scale forcing ahead of the low. This resulted in an increase in scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms near and south of the warm front from the late evening hours of the 24th through the early morning hours of the 25th across East Texas and North Louisiana. Coupled with the strong wind shear present across the expanding warm sector, several supercell thunderstorms developed, with one supercell spawning six separate tornadoes from San Augustine Texas northeast to Eastern Union Parish Louisiana, directly impacting the cities of San Augustine Texas and Ruston Louisiana along its 150+ mile track across the NWS Shreveport County Warning Area. In fact, this supercell spawned another tornado across Northwest Morehouse and Southern Ashley County Arkansas, to complete its nearly 180 mile track before dissipating. Other isolated supercells developed near and south of the warm front which spawned tornadoes across Northern Caddo Parish and Central La Salle Parish in Northern Louisiana, with other severe thunderstorms producing damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana as well, before the storms exited the region around daybreak on the 25th.","Numerous trees were downed at the Cypress Bend Park on Toledo Bend Reservoir.

A day plus prior, late on the 10th and into the 11th, a cold front slid through the state, dropping temperatures a solid 10 to 15 degrees. While that itself only put the state into the 40s and upper 30s, it also allowed cooler and drier air to continue to filter in. By the evening of the 12th, the parent low pressure system to the aforementioned cold front remained rooted in northern Minnesota and deepened, yielding southwesterly winds across Iowa. Even with the southerly flow, dew points in the low to mid 20s and mostly clear skies allowed temperatures to drop below freezing statewide. The coldest temperatures, into the mid and uppe 20s, were seen in the valley areas such as the Nishnabotna. The remainder of the state did manage to drop to around 30.","","CSV"

As the surface front moved through Iowa, it stalled out and effectively divided the state in half as it oriented it self from southwest to northeast across the state. While the itself stalled, it separated two distinctly different air masses with temperatures in the 50s to low 70s prevailing on the north side and 80s to around 90 prevailing to the south. Surface moisture was also divided with dew points in the 50s on the cool side and low to mid 70s on the warm side. ||Showers and storms persisted north of the front overnight of the 30th into the 1st and during much of the day of the 1st. That activity yielded little more than periods of moderate to heavy rain and sub-severe thunderstorms. Along and south of the front, thermodynamic and kinematics yielded much more vigorous storms and ultimately heavy rainfall and severe weather. SBCAPE profiles yielded 2000 to 3000+ J/kg by early to mid afternoon along with effective bulk shear around 50 to 60 kts, and persistent strong moisture flow yielding precipitable water values around 1.75 to 2.0 inches. Additionally, in the lowest 1 to 3 km, CAPE values exceed 100 J/kg and was accompanied by enhanced low level helicity due to frontal proximity. As a result, virtually all modes of severe weather were possible. In the end, the majority of reports revolved around severe hail, nearing 3 inches in diameter, and heavy rainfall in excess of 3 to 4 inches.

A strong pressure gradient set up over the region between the departing low pressure system and the incoming surface high resulting in winds to 30 - 35 mph across the region. These strong winds along with the extreme cold allowed for wind chills to drop below zero degrees by midday on January 29 and not return above zero until late on January 31. The coldest temperatures during this event were on the morning of January 30 with several locations approaching or exceeding record low temperatures in the -5F to -11F range. During these coldest temperatures, the wind chill reached -25F for several hours across the entire area with several locations reaching wind chill values of -35F to -40F for a time. Temperatures on January 30 stayed near or below zero for much of the day and dropped back below zero on the morning of January 31. Record low temperatures were set again on January 31, but the winds had subsided to 15 to 20 mph across the area, allowing for wind chills in the -15F to -20F range. Temperatures reached the upper single digits during the day on January 31 and winds subsided to light and variable, ending the extreme cold threat. Four deaths were reported in Ohio as a result of the extreme cold. All area schools closed on both January 30 and 31 due to the cold conditions.","Extremely cold weather settled over the area on January 30 and 31, bringing the coldest temperatures that the region had seen in four or five years.

In the wake of this low, an arctic cold front moved through the lower Great Lakes region early on January 29, allowing for arctic high pressure to build over the midwest, setting up an extremely cold pattern for January 29 - 31. The blistering cold that entered the region resulted in temperatures on January 30 and 31 being some of the coldest recorded in five years. A strong pressure gradient set up over the region between the departing low pressure system and the incoming surface high resulting in winds to 30 - 35 mph across the region. These strong winds along with the extreme cold allowed for wind chills to drop below zero degrees by midday on January 29 and not return above zero until late on January 31. The coldest temperatures during this event were on the morning of January 30 with several locations approaching or exceeding record low temperatures in the -5F to -11F range. During these coldest temperatures, the wind chill reached -25F for several hours across the entire area with several locations reaching wind chill values of -35F to -40F for a time. Temperatures on January 30 stayed near or below zero for much of the day and dropped back below zero on the morning of January 31. Record low temperatures were set again on January 31, but the winds had subsided to 15 to 20 mph across the area, allowing for wind chills in the -15F to -20F range. Temperatures reached the upper single digits during the day on January 31 and winds subsided to light and variable, ending the extreme cold threat. Four deaths were reported in Ohio as a result of the extreme cold. All area schools closed on both January 30 and 31 due to the cold conditions.","Extremely cold weather settled over the area on January 30 and 31, bringing the coldest temperatures that the region had seen in four or five years.

So, while more than 1 of liquid fell in many areas, this translated to roughly 5 to 8 inches of snow. Some of that liquid fell as rain, but the low snow to liquid ratio caused it to be a rather densely packed snow which clung to trees across the area, forming a picturesque winter wonderland. Snow continued to fall through the day on January 12, but most of the snowfall occurred through the night between January 11 and 12. Some totals in the region exceeded 12 inches, but most areas ended up with between 5 and 8 inches.

In the wake of this low, an arctic cold front moved through the lower Great Lakes region early on January 29, allowing for arctic high pressure to build over the midwest, setting up an extremely cold pattern for January 29 - 31. The blistering cold that entered the region resulted in temperatures on January 30 and 31 being some of the coldest recorded in five years.

These strong winds along with the extreme cold allowed for wind chills to drop below zero degrees by midday on January 29 and not return above zero until late on January 31. The coldest temperatures during this event were on the morning of January 30 with several locations approaching or exceeding record low temperatures in the -5F to -11F range. During these coldest temperatures, the wind chill reached -25F for several hours across the entire area with several locations reaching wind chill values of -35F to -40F for a time. Temperatures on January 30 stayed near or below zero for much of the day and dropped back below zero on the morning of January 31. Record low temperatures were set again on January 31, but the winds had subsided to 15 to 20 mph across the area, allowing for wind chills in the -15F to -20F range. Temperatures reached the upper single digits during the day on January 31 and winds subsided to light and variable, ending the extreme cold threat. Four deaths were reported in Ohio as a result of the extreme cold. All area schools closed on both January 30 and 31 due to the cold conditions.","Extremely cold weather settled over the area on January 30 and 31, bringing the coldest temperatures that the region had seen in four or five years.

One storm even produced a brief tornado after interacting with a mesoscale boundary.","A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado in Chatham County. The tornado began over the Wilmington River, just west of the Savannah Yacht Club on Whitemarsh Island. It developed rapidly as it hit the Savannah Yacht Club. At the time the tornado struck, a boat was being lifted by a crane at the dock. This boat was thrown from the crane back into the water. The boat crane was also pushed by the winds of the tornado off its track, which caused it to crash into a small building near the crane. This small building sustained significant roof damage. One person was reportedly injured inside the building, but the extent of their injuries was unknown. The tornado continued moving east-southeast , snapping and uprooting several trees in a residential area near the end of Bradley Creek Drive. One home in that area also had minor roof damage due to missing shingles. From this point, the tornado strengthened as it moved southeast over Bradley Creek and across portions of Turners Rock Road. This was the region where the most significant damage was found, with at least two dozen large hard and softwood trees either snapped or uprooted. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be between 100 and 105 mph. The tornado then weakened as it moved on a more easterly path across Turner Creek and onto the western edge of Wilmington Island, just south of Johnny Mercer Boulevard. The tornado broke some tree limbs and branches around Walgreens, then damaged a sign near the Autoplex as it crossed Johnny Mercer Boulevard. Once across Johnny Mercer Boulevard, the weakening tornado skipped over Molly McGuire's restaurant, finally ending in the empty lot just east of the Goodwill store. The roof on the Goodwill store sustained minor damage.","CSV"

Many areas in central and northern Iowa had around a foot to two feet of snow on the ground, along with many areas in upstream river basins in Minnesota and the Dakotas having similar or deeper snowpacks on the ground. Additionally, with the below normal temperatures throughout the majority of the 2019 year to date, soils were frozen to depths of a foot or more throughout the aforementioned areas. All of that primed the area for potential moderate to major flooding issues should a rapid snowmelt and/or rainfall event occur, which unfortunately came to fruition. ||The primary driver was two-fold with warm air advection on the backside of a departing high pressure on the 12th, and a sizable low pressure system that moved through the region on the 13th and 14th. The event began with widespread temperatures and dew points in the upper 30s to low 40s on the 12th with the initial warm air advection, which continued through the overnight hours into the 13th. As the low pressure system developed off the Colorado Rockies, warm air advection continued to push temperatures and dew points up into the upper 40s and low 50s on the 13th and 14th, aiding the rapid snow melt. On top of the rapid snowmelt, which often went from 12 or more inches on the ground to zero in a matter of about two days, light to moderate rainfall occurred ahead of and on the backside of the low pressure system on the 13th and 14th. All combined to cause widespread overland flooding, river flooding, and ice jam issues.","Emergency management and river gauges reported 8 to 10 foot rises on the Middle Raccoon and South Raccoon Rivers due to ice jams. Several county roads were impacts with road closures. Flooding was also reported along Highway 44 between Panora and Dallas Center from heavy rain and snowmelt.

Some temperatures had lowered to zero to +10F.  On 1/10 there was a burst of warm moist air that moved over the Panhandle from the south causing numerous winter weather advisories to be issued. Warnings were issued for both the Juneau and Hyder areas due to heavy snow. Impacts: intense snow removal, poor driving conditions, and travel disrupted. The Juneau School District closed schools. ||Details: Bands of snow set up over the central panhandle with the core over Juneau over an extended period of time. Outside of Juneau bands caused heavy snow in Gustavus, Hoonah, Tenakee Springs and Angoon. Prior to the snow reaching the central panhandle, snow fell across the south, changing to rain in Ketchikan and Hydaburg on time, but lasting longer over from Coffman Cove to Edna Bay north. The main low center remained over the far SE gulf/SW of Sitka. This caused NELY flow through inside passages including Klawock/Angoon and down Chatham Strait which kept surface temperatures colder longer, even through temperatures aloft were warming. The prolonged NE flow kept Angoon as below freezing until about noon Friday the 11th, at this time the low was moving inland and weakening. The wind shifted for Angoon enough to change to rain, but remained cold enough for snow to continue in the Juneau area through 4pm Friday. However, during the day Friday the flakes became more icy or pellets, which caused the light fluffy snow that had fallen all day Thursday to compact down significantly and limit additional depth - altough observers in Angoon and Hoonah noting still needing to clear a lot of snow off their vehicles multiple times.","Storm total snow for the Juneau area, 1/10 to 1/12 was 11 to 17 inches.

Some temperatures had lowered to zero to +10F.  On 1/10 there was a burst of warm moist air that moved over the Panhandle from the south causing numerous winter weather advisories to be issued. Warnings were issued for both the Juneau and Hyder areas due to heavy snow. Impacts: intense snow removal, poor driving conditions, and travel disrupted. The Juneau School District closed schools. ||Details: Bands of snow set up over the central panhandle with the core over Juneau over an extended period of time. Outside of Juneau bands caused heavy snow in Gustavus, Hoonah, Tenakee Springs and Angoon. Prior to the snow reaching the central panhandle, snow fell across the south, changing to rain in Ketchikan and Hydaburg on time, but lasting longer over from Coffman Cove to Edna Bay north. The main low center remained over the far SE gulf/SW of Sitka. This caused NELY flow through inside passages including Klawock/Angoon and down Chatham Strait which kept surface temperatures colder longer, even through temperatures aloft were warming. The prolonged NE flow kept Angoon as below freezing until about noon Friday the 11th, at this time the low was moving inland and weakening. The wind shifted for Angoon enough to change to rain, but remained cold enough for snow to continue in the Juneau area through 4pm Friday. However, during the day Friday the flakes became more icy or pellets, which caused the light fluffy snow that had fallen all day Thursday to compact down significantly and limit additional depth - altough observers in Angoon and Hoonah noting still needing to clear a lot of snow off their vehicles multiple times.","Storm total snow for Angoon was 13 inches in 24 hours ending 1600 on 1/11.","CSV"

Some temperatures had lowered to zero to +10F.  On 1/10 there was a burst of warm moist air that moved over the Panhandle from the south causing numerous winter weather advisories to be issued. Warnings were issued for both the Juneau and Hyder areas due to heavy snow. Impacts: intense snow removal, poor driving conditions, and travel disrupted. The Juneau School District closed schools. ||Details: Bands of snow set up over the central panhandle with the core over Juneau over an extended period of time. Outside of Juneau bands caused heavy snow in Gustavus, Hoonah, Tenakee Springs and Angoon. Prior to the snow reaching the central panhandle, snow fell across the south, changing to rain in Ketchikan and Hydaburg on time, but lasting longer over from Coffman Cove to Edna Bay north. The main low center remained over the far SE gulf/SW of Sitka. This caused NELY flow through inside passages including Klawock/Angoon and down Chatham Strait which kept surface temperatures colder longer, even through temperatures aloft were warming. The prolonged NE flow kept Angoon as below freezing until about noon Friday the 11th, at this time the low was moving inland and weakening. The wind shifted for Angoon enough to change to rain, but remained cold enough for snow to continue in the Juneau area through 4pm Friday. However, during the day Friday the flakes became more icy or pellets, which caused the light fluffy snow that had fallen all day Thursday to compact down significantly and limit additional depth - altough observers in Angoon and Hoonah noting still needing to clear a lot of snow off their vehicles multiple times.","Petersburg had a storm total 12 inches.

Temperatures surged into the 40s to mid-50s. Steady rainfall occurred during much of the 24th as a secondary low pressure system developed over the Mid-Atlantic and tracked into southern New England. One to two inches of rainfall occurred over much of the region, although a few reports of three to four inches were recorded over portions of the southern Adirondacks and the eastern Catskills. New daily rainfall records were set at Albany, Glens Falls, and Poughkeepsie.||The combination of the rainfall along with the mild temperatures melting some of the snow resulted in urban and poor drainage flooding over portions of the region along with minor to moderate river flooding in the Hoosic basin. Some ice jam flooding also occurred. Numerous road closures also occurred due to flooding in Washington County, NY.

New daily rainfall records were set at Albany, Glens Falls, and Poughkeepsie.||The combination of the rainfall along with the mild temperatures melting some of the snow resulted in urban and poor drainage flooding over portions of the region along with minor to moderate river flooding in the Hoosic basin. Some ice jam flooding also occurred. Numerous road closures also occurred due to flooding in Washington County, NY. In addition, seven vessels along the Hudson River near Troy were ripped from their moorings during the early morning of the 25th, likely by a surge of water and ice from upstream.
