As the tornado tracked north-northeast, it snapped hardwood trees and uprooted numerous trees. One tree fell on a house on Smith Street, which caused roof damage. The tornado then tracked toward the northeast, crossing the Natchez Trace Parkway and Highway 18. Here it continued to snap or uproot trees and also caused roof damage to a structure. An extensive area of trees were snapped or blown down just before it crossed the Natchez Trace corridor a second time. After crossing the Natchez Trace Parkway again, it continued to snap and blow down numerous trees. As the tornado tracked northeast, it crossed Old Port Gibson Road, Hankinson Road, and Moulder Road where it continued to snap or uproot numerous trees. The tornado finally lifted near Fisher Ferry Road in southern Warren County. A tornado debris signature was noted on radar during this tornado. The total path length of this tornado was 20.03 miles. The total path width was one half of a mile (880 yards) and the estimated maximum wind speed was 115 mph, both of which occurred in Claiborne County.","CSV"

The storms were isolated with large hail initially, but a stronger cluster of storms approached from the west after 6 pm.  The main hazard with these storms was wind damage as they moved from the Mohawk Valley through the Capital District and into the Lake George Saratoga region by the evening hours.  Numerous reports of downed trees and powerlines occurred in this area.  The worst damage occurred from Queensbury in Warren County to Kingsbury in Washington County.  These storms produced a macroburst, or concentrated area of straight line wind damage.  These winds were measured at 68 mph at the Glens Falls New York State Mesonet site, and were estimated to be as high as 90 mph, resulting in widespread tree damage, destroying a barn, and damaging the roofs of a couple of other buildings.

Although there were multiple reports of large hail, and some were measured up to golf ball size, the combination of strong winds and hail, took a toll on property, especially in the Twin Cities metro area. The county of Anoka reported some areas receiving up to two feet of hail which caused several cities to use snow plows. The county of Anoka also reported $650,000 in damage to public property and infrastructure.||Wind speeds were measured in several areas up to 70 knots indicating the severity of the storms as torrential rain and hail accompanied the wind.

A weather spotter said the cinder block structure was destroyed by the force of the storm.

A line of strong to severe thunderstorms with embedded circulations, known as a Quasi-Linear Convective System (or QLCS), moved rapidly across Middle Tennessee at 60-70 mph from west to east between 6 AM and 10 AM CST. Additional severe thunderstorms developed later in the morning and affected areas of southern Middle Tennessee from the late morning into the early afternoon hours.

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Radar estimated around two to over three inches of rain fell over portions of Sandusky and Seneca Counties on the afternoon of November 18. 911 centers reported widespread flooding in the counties with dozens of road closures in each county. Over 48 hours after the initial overland flooding mentioned here, the Portage and Sandusky Rivers flooded. The Portage River reached moderate flood stage and the Sandusky River reached minor flood stage. This lead to continued road closures for known spots along the rivers. No properties were inundated. ||In Seneca County as of 7:30 p.m., there were reports of at least 19 roads that were flooded. These roads included US 224 east of SR 67; CR 50 near the 2000 block; SR 4 near SR 162; CR 48 near SR 18 at the viaduct; the 4000, 5000 and 7000 blocks of South SR 53; SR 231 North of CR 6; CR 37 between CR 38 and CR 15; CR 58 between SR 19 and SR 4; and the westbound lane of US 224 in the 11000 block east of Attica. There also was flooding or closures at CR 43 and CR 38; CR 48 and TR 123; SR 635 south of CR 592; TR 15 between SR 18 and CR 50; Lelar Street in Clinton Township; the 7000 block of East SR 18; Euclid Avenue between Sandusky Street and Hopewell Avenue; and CR 592 west of SR 635, she said. The spokeswoman said three-fourths of a mile north of Izakk Walton League CR 33 had gravel wash out on the shoulder and SR 101 near Clinton Township Volunteer Fire Department was flooded. ||In Sandusky County as of 830 pm the roads flooded included:|County Road 128 between Turnpike and Cr 127 (signs posted)|County Road 183 approximately �� mile east of State Rte 101|County Road 223 between 242 and 232 also between 260 and 268(2 Places)|County Road 223 between Woodland Ave. and State Rte 510|COUNTY ROAD 201 AND BUCHANAN (signs posted)|CR 117 (FINDLEY RD) AND CR 48 WOODVILLE|CR 164 between CR 215 and OTTAWA CO LINE (SIGNS POSTED) CLOSED|STATE RTE 412 AND STATE RTE 101|COUNTY ROAD 260 BETWEEN 183 AND 177 ALSO BETWEEN 183 AND 175|Finefrock Rd.

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Two round of rain moved into Hancock County on the 18th. The morning rain of over an inch was followed by a heavier rain in the early afternoon with almost two inches. The heavier rain which fell on saturated ground caused widespread minor flooding and road closures in the area. Rainfall reports show two and a half inches to almost three inches. The resultant runoff caused the Eagle and Lye Creeks, and the Blanchard River to reach moderate flood stages. The elevated streambeds caused the local flood waters to linger into Sunday. ||The Hancock County Sheriff���s Office  issued this list of flooded roadways: |SR 103 - CR 9  - Van Buren Twp.|SR 235 - TR 29 - Orange Twp.|CR 139 - North of  SR 12 - Liberty Twp. |SR 613 - CR 140 and TR 142 - Allen Twp.|SR 235 - South of US 224 - Blanchard Twp. |CR 18 CLOSED - North of TR 213 - Allen Twp.|SR 613 - Stretch from I-75 to Fostoria - Allen, Cass, Washington Twp.|US 224 - CR 140 - Liberty Twp.|TR 215 CLOSED - CR 18 to TR 236 - Cass Twp.|CR 330- South of SR 568 - Biglick Twp.|CR 304 - West of CR 698 - Van Buren Twp.|SR 103 - Between TR 59 and TR 60 - Orange Twp.  |13000-14100 Block of CR 9 - Eagle Twp.|CR 9 - CR 24 - Eagle Twp.|CR 9 - CR 31 - Eagle Twp.|CR 304 - Between TR 61 and TR 698 - Van Buren Twp. |9000 Block of SR 235 - Blanchard Twp. |CR 139 - TR 95 to CR 97 - Portage Twp. |SR 613 - East of CR 139 - Portage Twp. |SR 186 - South of McComb - Pleasant Twp.|CR 172 - Near TR 240 - Jackson Twp.|CR 330 CLOSED - South of SR 12 - Washington Twp. |US 68 - TR 69 - Madison Twp.|TR 214 CLOSED - Between CR 248 and SR 12 - Cass, Washington Twp.|CR 7 - Between SR 568 and CR 248 - Biglick Twp.|CR 7 - Between CR 248 and TR 251 - Biglick Twp.|TR 70 CLOSED - Between CR 24 and TR 25 - Eagle Twp.|TR 25 CLOSED - Between TR 72 and CR 9 - Eagle Twp.|TR 72 CLOSED - Between CR 26 and TR 25 - Eagle Twp.|CR 203 CLOSED - Between CR 139 and CR 140 - Portage|CR 5 - 24,000 Block - Pleasant Twp.|CR 216 CLOSED - Between CR 23 and TR 260 - Washington Twp.|TR 234 - North of SR 37 - Marion Twp.|TR 208 CLOSED - Between TR 234 and TR 240 - Marion Twp.|SR 37 - Near TR 234 - Marion Twp.|In Findlay, water rose on I-75 around 725 pm.","CSV"

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Two rounds of rain moved over Stark County on the 18th. The first round during the morning produced around an inch to an inch and a half of rainfall. The second round in the afternoon and evening brought an additional inch to inch and a half. Rainfall reports in the county showed around two inches in the north and west, and over three inches in Canton east and south. The resultant flooding was minor in Canton with flooding on the Zimber Ditch where there were reports of some basement flooding on Furbee and Lucille Avenues, with water approaching businesses on Whipple Avenue Northwest. East of Canton in Louisville the East Branch of the Nimishillen Creek came out of banks flooding State Rt. 153 and Constitution Ave. The most notable flooding was in the southeast part of the county where at 10 pm through 3 am water from the Sandy Creek inundated basements and surrounded homes in Waynesburg on Oakhurst, Grovedale, Broadford Streets, and flooding State Rt 183. Rainfall total estimates in this area were close to four inches.  Water backed up into a mobile home park on Cleveland Southwest Avenue in Canton Township from the Nimishillen Creek. North Industry High School recreational grounds inundated with several feet of water.","CSV"

Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage.

Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Morrow County received over 3 inches of rain on the 18th of November, with a measured 3.25��� at Mt. Gilead .

The disturbance provided several critical pieces of the atmospheric puzzle that would change miserable biting rain into a snowscape that brought impromptu celebrations of the season on a Friday, less than three weeks before Christmas. Light rain mixed with sleet and snow before changing to all snow, from northwest to southeast, during the pre-dawn hours of the 8th. The initial changeover occurred across the Rio Grande Plains of Jim Hogg and Zapata County between midnight and 2 AM, and would quickly scoot through the remaining ranch country before 4 AM, and reach much of the populated Valley before 6 AM. Because the low levels of the atmosphere were marginally conducive to snow, the highest accumulations were seen in stronger bands that fell before sunrise at the slightly higher elevation of the ranchlands, which allowed temperatures to fall to 32 or 33��F for the duration of the band. In locations where the bands tapered off, or where bands were less intense, snow accumulation was limited and often the snow mixed with rain again.

From radar estimates, the heaviest snow fell between 1 and 4 AM and again between 5 and 7 AM. In general, between 2 and 5 inches fell across the primary ranch areas with the least amount of snow near Hebbronville.  The snow, falling overnight, created slushy accumulation along elevated bridges and an inch or more on unimproved ranch roads.","CSV"

Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Rainfall in Richland and Ashland Counties was heaviest south of Mansfield, where the airport reported 3.02��� for the event. The flooding impacts were primarily isolated to the central and southern half of the counties. There were reports of high water in Mansfield at Ohio 314 and Millsboro Road and Ohio 314 and Flowers Road.  Mansfield police said affected areas included the subway and Longview Avenue at Main Street. The street department was called to put up barricades. By 8 pm there were numerous roads flooded across the county. In Shelby the Black Fork was elevated causing the fire department to relocated out of harms way, but ultimately did not breach the banks. The Black Fork south of Melco and into the confluence with the Mohican River were flooded. In Ashland County, numerous campgrounds, vacant this time of year, were inundated in Loudonville from the Mohican River. Other areas in Ashland County that saw flooding were  OH-603 and OH-430, as well as County Road 251, just north of County Road 1302. The Ashland County Sheriff���s Office said County Road 1600 between County Road 1575 and County Road 655 in Montgomery Township was closed with high water crossing the road just west of County Road 1575.

The snow began around 1 am CST in the Lexington area and ended across the region at 11 pm. The band ebbed and waned at various locations and times throughout the day, but light snow was steadiest over the largest area during the afternoon and evening hours. The highest amount reported was 4.9 inches in the town of Cozad.||At the surface, arctic air was firmly entrenched over the Great Plains. The front that introduced the arctic air was over the Gulf of Mexico and the Rio Grande River. Throughout the day, arctic high pressure gradually slipped from Montana into Nebraska. In the upper-levels, the Westerlies were zonal. This snow band was generated by persistent mid-level frontogenesis. There was no synoptic-scale forcing, so snowfall amounts were light.","A narrow band of 2-4 of snow was reported across the area.","CSV"

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports. On Sunday, lake effect bands reoriented on a northwesterly flow.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports. On Sunday, lake effect bands reoriented on a northwesterly flow.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports. On Sunday, lake effect bands reoriented on a northwesterly flow. Lake effect snow began to diminish in intensity.  |Off Lake Erie, specific snowfall reports included:  46 inches at Perrysburg,  45 inches at Colden, 42 inches at Forestville, 33 inches at Springville, 28 inches at Blasdell, 27 inches at Glenwood, 26 inches at West Seneca and Boston, 24 inches at East Concord, 23 inches at Portland, West Seneca and Hamburg, 21 inches at Dunkirk and Orchard Park, 20 inches at Fredonia, 19 inches at Angola and Warsaw, 18 inches at Little Valley, East Aurora and Marilla, 17 inches at Ripley, 16 inches at Dayton, Silver Creek and New Albion, 14 inches at Attica and Wyoming,13 inches at Lackawanna, 12 inches at Kennedy and Warsaw, 11 inches at Franklinville, and 10 inches at Randolph.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports.

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Early day rains brought about an inch and a half to the Mt. Vernon area and across Knox County producing nuisance flooding of ponding on roads. A second round of heavier rain showers, and a few embedded thunderstorms, brought another inch to inch and a half to the area. Storm total rainfall at Mt. Vernon was 3.55 inches. The resultant flooding Saturday Night was more noteworthy and impactful than the first round.  The Dry Creek near Mt. Liberty in southwest Knox County washed out the Simmons Church Road bridge between 3226 & 3303.  One home had to be evacuated due to flooding at Waterford Road in Middlebury Township along the North Branch of the Kokosing River. Near Mt. Vernon several culverts washed out,  there was water in several basements, and numerous roads were closed by flowing water.  The Center Run waters threatened flooding of homes in Mount Vernon but ultimately did not inundate the buildings. ||In Knox County the following roads were flooded starting around 730 pm November 18: There was several inches of flowing water from Mile Run on Lucerne Road in Fredericktown. Other roads with flooding included Watson Road and State Route 661 just south of Brandon.  Beckley Road between State Route 13 and Bryant Road from the North Branch of the Kokosing River. Lower Gambrier Road in the Kokosing Gap Trail parking lot in Mt. Vernon flooded from the Kokosing River.

Very strong southerly winds transported rich tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico across much of EastCentral Texas, North Louisiana, Southwest Arkansas, and Eastern Oklahoma, with much above normal temperatures returning north across the warm sector as far north as Southern and Eastern Oklahoma. This helped to enhance the instability over these areas, where strong wind shear and deep layer forcing increased well ahead of the upper low over the Interstate 35 corridor of Northcentral Texas. Meanwhile, a shortwave trough ejected northeast across Southeast Texas and Northcentral Louisiana ahead of the closed low during the late morning through the afternoon hours, with scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developing over portions of Deep East Texas which spread northeast and intensified across Northcentral Louisiana.

The line intensified as it approached the Mississippi River and caused wind damage and tornadoes. As the convective system evolved into Mississippi, numerous tornadoes developed along the advancing line, with the most prolific damage occurring along the track of a large meso-scale convective vortex (MCV). This feature tracked roughly from Claiborne County through western Hinds/Madison, eastern Yazoo, eastern Holmes, southeastern Carroll, Montgomery, and northwestern Webster counties. This corridor is where the most significant damage occurred, as well as one fatality. Flash flooding, hail, and other wind damage occurred as these storms moved through.","This strong tornado started several miles west of Pickens off Highway 432 and tracked Northeast for roughly 23 miles. The tornado impacted areas west of Goodman, Holmes County State Park and a direct hit on the town of Durant. The tornado was very wide and was roughly 1.2 miles wide at its widest point. Across the entire path, thousands of trees were damaged/uprooted/snapped. Hundreds of power poles and power lines were down as well. The large majority of structures that were damaged were indicated by minor to moderate roof damage with singles/siding torn off to partial loss of decking. Multiple structures were more heavily damaged by trees falling on them. Some of the more significant tree and structural damage occurred along Courts Road, Salem Road, Ebenezer Pickens Road and Jordan Road. Four mobile homes were destroyed along Jordan Road, including a new, well secured, mobile home. Significant tree damage also occurred along Highway 51 and along State Park Road just west of Highway 51. The town of Durant took a direct hit.

The hot airmass, despite not being overly humid, provided an unstable environment conducive for thunderstorm development.  Thunderstorms began to form in the early afternoon over western New York along a lake breeze boundary.  These storms pushed into the Mohawk Valley by mid-afternoon.  The storms were isolated with large hail initially, but a stronger cluster of storms approached from the west after 6 pm.  The main hazard with these storms was wind damage as they moved from the Mohawk Valley through the Capital District and into the Lake George Saratoga region by the evening hours.  Numerous reports of downed trees and powerlines occurred in this area.  The worst damage occurred from Queensbury in Warren County to Kingsbury in Washington County.  These storms produced a macroburst, or concentrated area of straight line wind damage.  These winds were measured at 68 mph at the Glens Falls New York State Mesonet site, and were estimated to be as high as 90 mph, resulting in widespread tree damage, destroying a barn, and damaging the roofs of a couple of other buildings.  Another cluster of storms resulted in wind damage over portions of Dutchess County toward midnight.","The National Weather Service confirmed a macroburst (straight line wind damage) from Queensbury in Warren County to Kingsbury in Washington County. Confirmation was based on maps and pictures provided by Washington County Emergency Management, newspaper photos, storm damage reports from Warren County Emergency Management and trained spotter reports.||Winds from the macroburst brought down hundreds of trees, flattened a barn and threw its roof a quarter mile, and tore part of a roof off a building. Power outages, damage to homes from falling trees, and road closures were widespread in this area. The worst part of the damage swath passed just north of the Glens Falls New York State Mesonet observation site, which recorded a gust of 68 mph.","CSV"

Initially, trees were snapped and uprooted along county road 28 and county road 27. The tornado then crossed Highway 51 where numerous trees were snapped or uprooted and power lines were downed. A few homes sustained minor roof damage and one had a large tree down on it. The railroad was blocked by several trees as well. The tornado then crossed Highway 35 where more trees were damaged. It then moved into a wooded area and mostly tracked south of Highway 430. A few damage locations were accessible along CR 9 where more trees were downed, but the road was blocked and the core of the tornado path was inaccessible. The Northwest edge of the tornado began to impact portions of Highway 430 a few miles before the junction with Highway 407. Here numerous trees were damaged. The tornado appeared to peak in intensity and reach its widest point near the Carroll and Montgomery County line and along Highway 407. Here, significant tree damage was noted as the tornado moved across an open field and slammed into a wooded area. Significant tree damage was noted across the field south of the highway and where it crossed Highway 407. Widespread tree damage continued across Herring Loop, Lower Bethlehem Road, and Herring School Road. Some homes were damaged by trees. Along Herring School Road, a couple sheds were destroyed along with several homes sustaining minor roof damage. A large metal I-beam shed was destroyed and thrown nearly 100 yards. As the tornado neared Kindred Road, a turn to the left was noted and it began to track more northerly. Damage to trees continued as it crossed Lewis CreekRoad along with a few sheds damaged and shingles off roofs. As it crossed Highway 82 west of Kilmichael, more trees were downed along with a dozen or so power poles. Three homes had roof damage and several sheds had tin off the roof. The tornado continued just a bit farther north and dissipated just past the intersection of Mayfield and Robinson-Thompson Road. The total path length of the tornado was 15.75miles. The maximum width of the tornado was 1.1 miles, which occurred in Montgomery County, as well as the highest wind speed of the tornado at 115 mph.","CSV"

Very strong southerly winds transported rich tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico across much of EastCentral Texas, North Louisiana, Southwest Arkansas, and Eastern Oklahoma, with much above normal temperatures returning north across the warm sector as far north as Southern and Eastern Oklahoma. This helped to enhance the instability over these areas, where strong wind shear and deep layer forcing increased well ahead of the upper low over the Interstate 35 corridor of Northcentral Texas. Meanwhile, a shortwave trough ejected northeast across Southeast Texas and Northcentral Louisiana ahead of the closed low during the late morning through the afternoon hours, with scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developing over portions of Deep East Texas which spread northeast and intensified across Northcentral Louisiana. One isolated supercell was responsible for extensive wind damage across these areas, while even spawning an isolated tornado over Central Natchitoches Parish just northwest of Natchitoches. Scattered showers and thunderstorms later developed near and east of the DFW Metroplex during the afternoon of the 29th, which spread east into East Texas by late afternoon and early evening. These storms gradually weakened as they entered the Ark-La-Tex, although sporadic wind and hail damage was observed across portions of extreme Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and Northwest Louisiana. These storms intensified a bit during the early morning hours of April 30th, with more concentrated reports of trees and power lines being blown down over portions of Northcentral Louisiana, and even an isolated tornado over Eastern Winn Parish. These storms exiting the region prior to daybreak on April 30th.","Numerous trees were blown down on Hill Street in Jonesboro.","CSV"

Very strong southerly winds transported rich tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico across much of EastCentral Texas, North Louisiana, Southwest Arkansas, and Eastern Oklahoma, with much above normal temperatures returning north across the warm sector as far north as Southern and Eastern Oklahoma. This helped to enhance the instability over these areas, where strong wind shear and deep layer forcing increased well ahead of the upper low over the Interstate 35 corridor of Northcentral Texas. Meanwhile, a shortwave trough ejected northeast across Southeast Texas and Northcentral Louisiana ahead of the closed low during the late morning through the afternoon hours, with scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developing over portions of Deep East Texas which spread northeast and intensified across Northcentral Louisiana. One isolated supercell was responsible for extensive wind damage across these areas, while even spawning an isolated tornado over Central Natchitoches Parish just northwest of Natchitoches. Scattered showers and thunderstorms later developed near and east of the DFW Metroplex during the afternoon of the 29th, which spread east into East Texas by late afternoon and early evening. These storms gradually weakened as they entered the Ark-La-Tex, although sporadic wind and hail damage was observed across portions of extreme Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and Northwest Louisiana. These storms intensified a bit during the early morning hours of April 30th, with more concentrated reports of trees and power lines being blown down over portions of Northcentral Louisiana, and even an isolated tornado over Eastern Winn Parish.

Meanwhile, a shortwave trough ejected northeast across Southeast Texas and Northcentral Louisiana ahead of the closed low during the late morning through the afternoon hours, with scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developing over portions of Deep East Texas which spread northeast and intensified across Northcentral Louisiana. One isolated supercell was responsible for extensive wind damage across these areas, while even spawning an isolated tornado over Central Natchitoches Parish just northwest of Natchitoches. Scattered showers and thunderstorms later developed near and east of the DFW Metroplex during the afternoon of the 29th, which spread east into East Texas by late afternoon and early evening.

Very strong southerly winds transported rich tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico across much of EastCentral Texas, North Louisiana, Southwest Arkansas, and Eastern Oklahoma, with much above normal temperatures returning north across the warm sector as far north as Southern and Eastern Oklahoma. This helped to enhance the instability over these areas, where strong wind shear and deep layer forcing increased well ahead of the upper low over the Interstate 35 corridor of Northcentral Texas. Meanwhile, a shortwave trough ejected northeast across Southeast Texas and Northcentral Louisiana ahead of the closed low during the late morning through the afternoon hours, with scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developing over portions of Deep East Texas which spread northeast and intensified across Northcentral Louisiana. One isolated supercell was responsible for extensive wind damage across these areas, while even spawning an isolated tornado over Central Natchitoches Parish just northwest of Natchitoches. Scattered showers and thunderstorms later developed near and east of the DFW Metroplex during the afternoon of the 29th, which spread east into East Texas by late afternoon and early evening. These storms gradually weakened as they entered the Ark-La-Tex, although sporadic wind and hail damage was observed across portions of extreme Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and Northwest Louisiana.

The line intensified as it approached the Mississippi River and caused wind damage and tornadoes. As the convective system evolved into Mississippi, numerous tornadoes developed along the advancing line, with the most prolific damage occurring along the track of a large meso-scale convective vortex (MCV). This feature tracked roughly from Claiborne County through western Hinds/Madison, eastern Yazoo, eastern Holmes, southeastern Carroll, Montgomery, and northwestern Webster counties. This corridor is where the most significant damage occurred, as well as one fatality. Flash flooding, hail, and other wind damage occurred as these storms moved through.","This strong tornado started several miles west of Pickens off Highway 432 and tracked northeast for roughly 23 miles. The tornado impacted areas west of Goodman, Holmes County State Park and a direct hit on the town of Durant. The tornado was very wide and was roughly 1.2 miles wide at its widest point. Across the entire path, thousands of trees were damaged/uprooted/snapped. Hundreds of power poles and power lines were down as well. The large majority of structures that were damaged were indicated by minor to moderate roof damage with singles/siding torn off to partial loss of decking. Multiple structures were more heavily damaged by trees falling on them. Some of the more significant tree and structural damage occurred along Courts Road, Salem Road, Ebenezer Pickens Road and Jordan Road. Four mobile homes were destroyed along Jordan Road, including a new, well secured, mobile home. Significant tree damage also occurred along Highway 51 and along State Park Road just west of Highway 51. The town of Durant took a direct hit. Many buildings and homes sustained minor to moderate roof damage. A few less sound structures were destroyed. Numerous power lines were also down. The tornado continued a bit further to the northeast before dissipating. The total path length was 23.4 miles.","CSV"

The storms were isolated with large hail initially, but a stronger cluster of storms approached from the west after 6 pm.  The main hazard with these storms was wind damage as they moved from the Mohawk Valley through the Capital District and into the Lake George Saratoga region by the evening hours.  Numerous reports of downed trees and powerlines occurred in this area.  The worst damage occurred from Queensbury in Warren County to Kingsbury in Washington County.  These storms produced a macroburst, or concentrated area of straight line wind damage.  These winds were measured at 68 mph at the Glens Falls New York State Mesonet site, and were estimated to be as high as 90 mph, resulting in widespread tree damage, destroying a barn, and damaging the roofs of a couple of other buildings.

Initially, trees were snapped and uprooted along county road 28 and county road 27. The tornado then crossed Highway 51 where numerous trees were snapped or uprooted and power lines were downed. A few homes sustained minor roof damage and one had a large tree down on it. The railroad was blocked by several trees as well. The tornado then crossed Highway 35 where more trees were damaged. It then moved into a wooded area and mostly tracked south of Highway 430. A few damage locations were accessible along CR 9 where more trees were downed, but the road was blocked and the core of the tornado path was inaccessible. The Northwest edge of the tornado began to impact portions of Highway 430 a few miles before the junction with Highway 407. Here numerous trees were damaged. The tornado appeared to peak in intensity and reach its widest point near the Carroll and Montgomery County line and along Highway 407. Here, significant tree damage was noted as the tornado moved across an open field and slammed into a wooded area. Significant tree damage was noted across the field south of the highway and where it crossed Highway 407. Widespread tree damage continued across Herring Loop, Lower Bethlehem Road, and Herring School Road. Some homes were damaged by trees. Along Herring School Road, a couple sheds were destroyed along with several homes sustaining minor roof damage. A large metal I-beam shed was destroyed and thrown nearly 100 yards. As the tornado neared Kindred Road, a turn to the left was noted and it began to track more northerly. Damage to trees continued as it crossed Lewis Creek Road along with a few sheds damaged and shingles off roofs. As it crossed Highway 82 west of Kilmichael, more trees were downed along with a dozen or so power poles. Three homes had roof damage and several sheds had tin off the roof. The tornado continued just a bit farther north and dissipated just past the intersection of Mayfield and Robinson-Thompson Road. The total path length of the tornado was 15.75 miles. The maximum width of the tornado was 1.1 miles, which occurred in Montgomery County, as well as the highest wind speed of the tornado at 115 mph. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado in Carroll County was 100 mph.","CSV"

Meanwhile, a shortwave trough ejected northeast across Southeast Texas and Northcentral Louisiana ahead of the closed low during the late morning through the afternoon hours, with scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developing over portions of Deep East Texas which spread northeast and intensified across Northcentral Louisiana. Scattered showers and thunderstorms later developed near and east of the DFW Metroplex during the afternoon of the 29th, which spread east into East Texas by late afternoon and early evening.

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Moderate to heavy rain fell over Marion County in two waves on November 18th. The first round of rain was during the morning when about an inch and a half fell. By the afternoon another round of showers with another inch to inch and a half fell. Rainfall totals from the area were 3.12 inches in Prospect, 2.50 inches in La Rue, and 2.12 inches in Marion. Widespread overland flooding occurred with numerous road closures. The hardest hit area was in the southern part of the county according to the County Engineer. The runoff resulted in several days of minor flooding along the Scioto River in La Rue, Green Camp, and Prospect. |Some of the roads closed included:|��� Morral Kirkpatrick Road between Ohio 231 and Powell Road, just east of Morral|��� Irvin Shoots Road between Hillman Ford Road and Ohio 423, north of Marion|��� Linn Hipsher Road between Caledonia Northern and Lyons roads, just north of Caledonia|��� Decliff Road between Ohio 95 and Agosta La Rue Road, just west of New Bloomington|��� Hillman Ford Road between Pleasant Hill and Marion Williamsport roads and between Kenton Galion and Pleasant Hill roads, northwest of Marion|��� Pleasant Hill Road between Hillman Ford and Holland roads, northwest of Marion|��� Holland Road between Marion Williamsport Road and Ohio 309, just west of Marion.","CSV"

With a very tight pressure gradient, winds increased ahead of the storm reaching in excess of 50 mph that led to some damage reports. A few periods of heavy rainfall occurred. Excessive rainfall close to 2 inches was focused in sections of Northern and Eastern New Jersey. The storm also brought a strong onshore flow which resulted in  minor to moderate tidal flooding for the high tide cycles on the 23rd and 24th. Minor tidal flooding occurred with the tidal cycles on the 23rd and the morning cycle on the 24th with a few reports of moderate tidal flooding on the 24th. Minor tidal flooding on the afternoon of the 23rd closed a lane on the George Redding bridge. Considerable beach erosion occurred during the event as well across all of New Jersey coastal counties, including a 70 percent loss of the dunes near the Matoloking and Harvey Ceders beaches.  It was also cold enough for a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain in the highest elevations in the northwest portion of the state. With road temperatures in the low 30's, some slick conditions were encountered with school delays as a result. Snow and sleet accumulations ranged from a couple tenths of an inch near Randolph Twp to almost three inches at Highland lakes. ice accumulation of three tenths was measured in Vernon. In addition, the Cape May Lewes ferry was closed for the day. Power outages from the storm were estimated at around 20,000. Numerous schools either dismissed early on the 23rd or had a delay/closing on the 24th. Ocean city, Wildwood schools were closed on the 24th.
